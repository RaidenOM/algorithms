# Bubble Sort

## Key Idea

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position in each pass. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Start from the beginning of the array.

- You will repeatedly compare adjacent pairs of elements.

**Step 2**: Compare adjacent elements.

- For every pair of elements next to each other (i.e., index `j` and `j+1`), check if the one on the left is greater than the one on the right.

**Step 3**: Swap if necessary.

- If the element on the left is greater, swap the two elements.

**Step 4**: Repeat the process for the entire array.

- One full pass of this process will move the largest unsorted element to the end of the array.

**Step 5**: Reduce the range.

- After each full pass, ignore the last element(s) of the array, as they are already in their correct position.

**Step 6**: Check if any swaps were made.

- If during a full pass, no swaps were made, the array is already sorted. You can stop early for efficiency.

**Step 7**: Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

## Implementation

```java
public static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        boolean swapped = false;
        for (int j = 0; j < n - 1 - i; j++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                swap(arr, i, j);
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
        if (!swapped)
            return;
    }
}
```
