# Sort an Array with Two Types of Elements

This problem is a variation of partitioning algorithm of QuickSort. The problems based on this approach can be:

- Sort a Binary Array
- Seperate Even and Odd Numbers
- Seperate Negative and Positive Numbers

## Problem Statement

Given a binary array (i.e., an array that only contains 0s and 1s), rearrange or segregate the array so that:

- All `0`s appear on the left side.
- All `1`s appear on the right side.

## Key Idea

We use two-pointer approach to traverse the array from left and right. We swap elements based on the desired condition.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Pointers:

- Set `i = 0` (left index)
- Set `j = n - 1` (right index)

**Step 2**: Traverse the Array:

- While `i < j`, do the following:
  - If `arr[i]` is 0: It’s in the correct place. Move `i` forward.
  - If `arr[j]` is 1: It’s in the correct place. Move `j` backward.
  - If `arr[i] == 1` and `arr[j] == 0`: They are in the wrong places. Swap `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`, then move both pointers inward.

**Step 3**: Repeat this process until `i >= j`.

## Implementation

```java
void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
    int temp = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[j];
    arr[j] = temp;
}

void segregate0and1(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int i = 0;
    int j = n - 1;
    while(i < j) {
        if(arr[i] == 0 || arr[j] == 1) {
            if(arr[i] == 0) i++;
            else j--;
        }
        else {
            swap(arr, i, j);
            j--;
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```
