# Insertion Sort

## Key Idea

Insertion Sort builds the sorted part of the array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position, elements are shifted to right and new element is inserted at its correct position.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Start from the second element (index 1)

- The element at index 0 is considered already sorted.

**Step 2**: Store the current element (called key)

- This is the value you want to insert into the sorted portion.

**Step 3**: Compare key with elements before it

- Start from the element just before it and move backward.

**Step 4**: Shift elements to the right

- As long as the elements are greater than key, move them one position to the right.

**Step 5**: Insert key in the correct position

- Once you find where key fits, insert it there.

**Step 6**: Repeat for all elements

- Continue until the entire array is sorted.

## Implementation

```java
public static void insertionSort(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;
        while (j > 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }
}
```
