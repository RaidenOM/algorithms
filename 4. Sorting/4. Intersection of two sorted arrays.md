# Intersection of two sorted arrays

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize two pointers:

- `i` for traversing the first array (`arr1`)
- `j` for traversing the second array (`arr2`)

**Step 2**: Use a while loop to traverse both arrays simultaneously as long as neither pointer has reached the end of its array.

**Step 3**: At each iteration:

- If the current element of `arr1` is less than that of `arr2`, increment `i` (move forward in `arr1`).
- If the current element of `arr1` is greater than that of `arr2`, increment `j` (move forward in `arr2`).
- If the current elements are equal:

  - Check if itâ€™s the first occurrence (to avoid duplicates in output). If it's the first element or different from the previous one, print it.

  - Increment both `i` and `j` to move forward.

**Step 4**: The loop stops when at least one of the arrays is fully traversed.
