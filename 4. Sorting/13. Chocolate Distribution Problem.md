# Chocolate Distribution Problem

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr[]` where each element represents the number of chocolates in a packet, and an integer `m` representing the number of students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among the students such that:

- Each student gets exactly **one packet**.
- The difference between the **maximum** and **minimum** chocolates given to any student is **minimized**.

Return the **minimum possible difference**.

## Key Idea

To **minimize the difference** between the most and least chocolates distributed:

- **Sort** the array so that packets are in increasing order of chocolates.
- The best choice for `m` packets is a **subarray of size** `m` where the **difference between the first and last elements is minimized**.

Why?

- Because sorting ensures that close values are grouped together, so the minimum range (difference) for any group of size `m` can be found by comparing `arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i]`.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Sort the List:

- First, sort the given list of integers (i.e., packets). Sorting ensures that similar-sized packets are near each other, which helps in minimizing the difference.

**Step 2**: Initialize Minimum Difference:

- Set a variable `minDifference` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to keep track of the smallest difference found so far.

**Step 3**: Slide a Window of Size m:

- Iterate through the list using a window of size `m`, starting from index `m - 1` to the end of the list.
- For each window, calculate the difference between the largest and smallest packets in that window:
  - Difference = `arr[i] - arr[i - (m - 1)]`

**Step 4**: Update Minimum Difference:

- For each window, update `minDifference` if the current difference is smaller than the previously recorded one.

**Step 5**: Return Result:

- After scanning all possible windows, return the smallest difference found.

## Implementation

```java
public int findMinDiff(int[] arr, int m) {
    Arrays.sort(arr);

    int minDifference = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    for(int i=m-1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, arr[i] - arr[i - (m - 1)]);
    }

    return minDifference;
}
```
