# Selection Sort

## Key Idea

Selection Sort works by repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the beginning. It builds the sorted array one element at a time by finding the minimum and moving it to its correct position.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Start at the beginning of the array.

- Assume the first unsorted element is the smallest.

**Step 2**: Find the smallest element in the remaining unsorted part.

- Compare it with every other element to the right.

**Step 3**: Track the position of the minimum element.

- Keep updating the index of the smallest value found so far.

**Step 4**: Swap the found minimum with the first unsorted element.

- This moves the smallest value to its correct place in the sorted part.

**Step 5**: Repeat for the rest of the array.

- Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts one step to the right.

**Step 6**: Continue until the entire array is sorted.

## Implementation

```java
public static void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;

    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int minIndex = i;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] < arr[minIndex]) {
                minIndex = j;
            }
        }
        swap(arr, i, minIndex);
    }
}
```
