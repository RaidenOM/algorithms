# Heapify (Min heap)

The heapify algorithm is used to maintain the heap property for a subtree rooted at a given index. This algorithm assumes that the subtrees of the node at given index are already heaps, but the node itself might violate the heap property.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Define Left and Right Child Indices

- Calculate the index of the left child of `startIndex`
- Calculate the index of the right child of `startIndex`.

**Step 2**: Initialize the Smallest Element

- Set smallestIndex to `startIndex` initially, assuming the node at `startIndex` is the smallest in the subtree.

**Step 3**: Compare with Left Child

- If `leftIndex` is within the bounds of the array (i.e., `leftIndex < size`), check if value at `leftIndex` is smaller than value at current `smallestIndex`
- If it is, update `smallestIndex` to `leftIndex`, indicating that the left child is smaller than the current node.

**Step 4**: Compare with Right Child

- If `rightIndex` is within bounds (`rightIndex < size`), check if value at `rightIndex` is smaller than value at current `smallestIndex`
- If it is, update `smallestIndex` to `rightIndex`, indicating that the right child is now the smallest among startIndex and its children.

**Step 5**: Check for Swap and Recursively Heapify

- If `smallestIndex` is not equal to `startIndex`, it means the heap property is violated because the node at `startIndex` is larger than at least one of its children.
- Swap the elements at `startIndex` and `smallestIndex`
- Recursively call `heapify(smallestIndex)` to ensure that the subtree rooted at `smallestIndex` also satisfies the heap property.

**Step 6**: End of Heapify

- If no swap was needed, the function terminates because the heap property is already satisfied.
- If swaps occur, each recursive heapify call will continue until the heap property is fully restored in the subtree.

## Implementation

```java
public void heapify(int startIndex) {
    int leftIndex = left(startIndex);
    int rightIndex = right(startIndex);

    int smallestIndex = startIndex;

    if (leftIndex < size && arr[leftIndex] < arr[smallestIndex]) {
        smallestIndex = leftIndex;
    }
    if (rightIndex < size && arr[rightIndex] < arr[smallestIndex]) {
        smallestIndex = rightIndex;
    }

    if (smallestIndex != startIndex) {
        swap(arr, startIndex, smallestIndex);
        heapify(smallestIndex);
    }
}
```

# Extract

The objective of the extraction process is to remove the root element (smallest or largest, depending on the type of heap) and then maintain the heap structure by reordering elements as necessary

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Check if the Heap is Empty

- If the heap has no elements (`size == 0`), return a special value like `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to indicate that extraction isn’t possible.

**Step 2**: Handle the Case of Only One Element

- If the heap has just one element, decrease size by 1, and return the root value.
- No further steps are necessary since there are no other elements to reorder.

**Step 3**: Store the Root Value

- For heaps with more than one element, save the root element (`arr[0]`) in a temporary variable because this will be the value to return at the end of the process.

**Step 4**: Swap the Last Element with the Root

- Move the last element in the heap (at `arr[size - 1]`) to the root position (`arr[0]`) by swapping it with the original root.
- This allows us to effectively remove the original root while preserving the remaining elements in the heap.

**Step 5**: Decrease the Heap Size

- Reduce size by 1 to account for the removed element.
- The last position is now "freed" and won’t be accessed since it’s no longer part of the active heap.

**Step 6**: Restore the Heap Property Using Heapify

- Call the heapify process on the root (now located at `arr[0]`) to maintain the heap property.
- The heapify function will reorder the elements, ensuring the smallest element bubbles up to the root in a min-heap, or the largest in a max-heap.

**Step 7**: Return the Original Root Value

- Finally, return the saved value of the original root (stored in the temporary variable) as the extracted element.

## Implementation

```java
public int extract() {
    if (size == 0)
        return Integer.MAX_VALUE;

    if (size == 1) {
        size--;
        return arr[0];
    }

    int temp = arr[0];
    swap(arr, size - 1, 0);
    size--;
    heapify(0);
    return temp;
}
```
