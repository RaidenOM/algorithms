# Nth node from end of Singly Linked List

## Key Idea

This function returns the n-th node from the end of a singly linked list using the two-pointer technique (also called the fast-slow pointer approach).

## Step by Step Algorithm:

**Step 1**: Check if the list is empty

- If `head == null`, it means the list is empty, and there is no node to return. So, the function returns `null`.

**Step 2**: Initialize two pointers

- `fastPtr` and `slowPtr` are both initialized to the head of the list.
- `fastPtr` will be used to traverse the list faster, while
- `slowPtr` will move at a regular pace.

**Step 3**: Advance the `fastPtr` by `n` nodes

- The first while loop moves `fastPtr` `n` steps ahead.
- After `n` steps, `fastPtr` will be `n` nodes ahead of `slowPtr`.
- If `n` exceeds the length of the list, `fastPtr` will become `null`, and the loop will stop before advancing `n` steps. In this case, the function would return `null` because it indicates that the list is shorter than `n`.

**Step 4**: Move both pointers simultaneously

- The second while loop moves both `fastPtr` and `slowPtr` one node at a time until fastPtr reaches the end of the list (`fastPtr == null`).
- At each step, both pointers move forward. Since `fastPtr` started `n` nodes ahead, when `fastPtr` reaches the end, `slowPtr` will be at the n-th node from the end.

**Step 5**: Return the `slowPtr`

- After the second loop ends, `slowPtr` will be pointing to the n-th node from the end, so the function returns `slowPtr`.

## Implementation

```java
public static SNode nthNodeFromEnd(SNode head, int n) {
    if (head == null)
        return null;

    SNode fastPtr = head;
    SNode slowPtr = head;

    int count = 0;

    while (count != n && fastPtr != null) {
        fastPtr = fastPtr.next;
        count++;
    }

    if (fastPtr == null)
        return null;

    while (fastPtr != null) {
        slowPtr = slowPtr.next;
        fastPtr = fastPtr.next;
    }

    return slowPtr;
}
```
