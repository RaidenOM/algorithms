# Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Singly Linked List

## Key Idea

The function is designed to remove consecutive duplicate nodes from a singly linked list. Specifically, it eliminates duplicates where two adjacent nodes have the same data.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Check if the list is empty

- The first if condition checks if the list is empty (`head == null`). If it is, there are no nodes to process, so the function simply returns immediately.

**Step 2**: Initialize the pointer

- The `current` pointer is initialized to head to start the traversal of the list from the first node.

**Step 3**: Traverse through the list

- The `while (current != null)` loop is used to traverse the list. The loop continues until current becomes `null`, meaning weâ€™ve reached the end of the list.

**Step 4**: Check for duplicates

- Inside the loop, the `if (current.next != null && current.next.data == current.data)` condition checks if:
  - There is a next node (`current.next != null`).
  - The data of the next node is the same as the data of the current node (`current.next.data == current.data`).

**Step 5**: Remove the duplicate node

- If both conditions are `true` (i.e., there is a duplicate), the next node (`current.next`) is skipped by setting `current.next = current.next.next`. This effectively removes the duplicate node from the list.

**Step 6**: Move to the next node

- If no duplicate is found, simply move current to the next node (`current = current.next`).

**Step 7**: Repeat until the end

- The loop continues until current reaches `null`, which signifies the end of the list.

## Implementation

```java
public static void removeDuplicateNodes(SNode head) {
    if (head == null)
        return;

    SNode current = head;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.next != null && current.next.data == current.data)
            current.next = current.next.next;
        else
            current = current.next;
    }
}
```
