# Postfix Evaluation

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize a Stack

- A stack is used to temporarily store operands (numbers) as the expression is processed. The stack will hold values until they are needed to evaluate operators.

**Step 2**: Split the Expression into Tokens

- The input string is split into tokens using the split(" ") method. The expression is assumed to be a space-separated string of operands and operators.

Example: For `3 4 +`, the tokens would be `["3", "4", "+"]`.

**Step 3**: Process Each Token

- For each token, the algorithm checks if the token is a digit (operand) or an operator.

**Step 4**: Handle Operands (Digits)

- If the token is a digit, it is pushed onto the stack.

Example: For token `"3"`, the stack becomes `["3"]`.

**Step 5**: Handle Operators

- If the token is an operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`):
  - **Pop two operands** from the stack.
    - The first operand is popped as the second operand because of the order of evaluation in postfix notation.
  - **Apply the operator**: The operator is applied to the two popped operands.
    - The operator is applied as follows:
      - `+`: Add the two operands.
      - `-`: Subtract the second operand from the first.
      - `*`: Multiply the operands.
      - `/`: Divide the first operand by the second (integer division).
      - `^`: Perform exponentiation (raising the second operand to the power of the first).
  - **Push the result** of the operation back onto the stack.
    Example:
    For the expression "3 4 +", we pop 3 and 4, compute 3 + 4 = 7, and push 7 back onto the stack.

**Step 6**: Repeat the Process

- This process continues until all tokens are processed.
- The stack will contain the final result after the last operator is processed.

**Step 7**: Final Result

- After all tokens have been processed, the stack will have one value left, which is the final result of the postfix expression evaluation.
- This value is then popped and returned.

## Implementation

```java
public static int postfixEvaluation(String str) {
    String[] tokens = str.split(" ");
    Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();

    for (String x : tokens) {
        if (tokenIsDigit(x)) {
            stack.push(x);
        } else {
            int operand1 = Integer.parseInt(stack.pop());
            int operand2 = Integer.parseInt(stack.pop());
            switch (x) {
                case "+":
                    stack.push(Integer.toString(operand2 + operand1));
                    break;
                case "-":
                    stack.push(Integer.toString(operand2 - operand1));
                    break;
                case "*":
                    stack.push(Integer.toString(operand2 * operand1));
                    break;
                case "/":
                    stack.push(Integer.toString(operand2 / operand1));
                    break;
                case "^":
                    stack.push(Integer.toString((int) Math.pow(operand2, operand1)));
                    break;
                default:
                    break;
            }
        }
    }

    return Integer.parseInt(stack.pop());
}

public static boolean tokenIsDigit(String str) {
    boolean flag = true;
    try {
        Integer.parseInt(str);
    }catch(NumberFormatException e) {
        flag = false;
    }

    return flag;
}
```
