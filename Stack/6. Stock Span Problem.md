# Stock Span Problem

Given an array of stock prices over days, we want to compute the "span" for each day. The span of a day is the maximum number of consecutive days (up to that day) that the stock price was less than or equal to the price on that day.

For example, if the prices are `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`, the spans are `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]`.

The span on day `i` is essentially asking, "How far back can we look, including today, such that every day has a price less than or equal to `arr[i]`?"

## How and Why It Works

The algorithm uses a stack to efficiently calculate spans in a single pass. A stack helps keep track of the indices of previous prices in a way that lets us quickly find the closest previous day with a higher stock price. By doing this, we avoid the need for nested loops, which would be inefficient.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize a Stack

- The stack will store indices of the prices array in a way that allows us to find previous days with higher prices than the current day.

**Step 2**: Set the First Span to 1

- For the first price, there are no previous prices, so the span is always 1.
- Push the index 0 onto the stack, representing the first price's index.

**Step 3**: Iterate Through the Array Starting from Day 1

**Step 4**: Pop Elements from Stack While the Price on Top of the Stack is Less Than or Equal to the Current Price

- This step ensures that we discard days where the price is less than or equal to `arr[i]`, since they cannot be the previous maximum for upcomming elements.
- After this loop, if the stack is empty, it means all previous prices were less than or equal to `arr[i]`.

**Step 5**: Calculate the Span

- If the stack is empty, it means all previous prices were smaller than or equal to `arr[i]`, so the span for day `i` is `i + 1`.
- If the stack is not empty, the top element on the stack is the nearest day with a price greater than `arr[i]`. The span is the difference between the current day and this nearest day: `i - stack.peek()`.

**Step 6**: Push the Current Day onto the Stack

- This makes day `i` the new "previous day" to check against future days.

**Step 7**: Output Each Span

- Print the span for each day after calculating it.

## Implementation

```java
public static void stockSpan(int[] arr) {
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    stack.push(0);  // Step 1: Push first index as there's no previous day
    System.out.println(1);  // Step 2: First day span is always 1

    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {  // Step 3: Iterate from day 1 to end
        // Step 4: Pop elements until the stack is empty or we find a price greater than arr[i]
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && arr[stack.peek()] <= arr[i]) {
            stack.pop();
        }

        // Step 5: Calculate span
        int span = stack.isEmpty() ? i + 1 : i - stack.peek();
        System.out.println(span);  // Print the calculated span for day i

        stack.push(i);  // Step 6: Push the current day index onto the stack
    }
}
```
