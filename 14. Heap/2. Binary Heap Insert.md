# Binary Heap Insert

To insert a new element into a binary heap, the goal is to maintain the heap properties after adding the new element. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this insertion algorithm works:

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Check if the Heap is Full

- If the current size equals the capacity of the heap array, no more elements can be inserted, so the function simply returns.

**Step 2**: Insert the New Element at the End

- Increase the size of the heap by `1`.
- Insert the new value at the last position in the array (`arr[size - 1]`).

**Step 3**: Heapify Up (Bubble Up) to Maintain Heap Property

- Set `i` as the index of the newly inserted element (`i = size - 1`).
- **While** `i` is not the root (`i != 0`) and the parent node's value is greater than the current node's value (`arr[parent(i)] > arr[i]`):
  - Swap the current node with its parent node (`swap(arr, i, parent(i))`).
  - Update `i` to be the parent index (`i = parent(i)`).
- This process continues until:
  - Either the current element is no longer smaller than its parent (in which case the heap property is restored).
  - Or the element reaches the root (index 0).

**Step 4**: End of Insert Operation

- After the loop, the element has "bubbled up" to its correct position, ensuring the heap properties are maintained.

## Implementation

```java
public void insert(int value) {
    if(size == capacity) return;
    size++;
    arr[size-1] = value;
    int i = size-1;
    while(i!=0 && arr[parent(i)] > arr[i]) {
        swap(arr, i, parent(i));
        i = parent(i);
    }
}
```
