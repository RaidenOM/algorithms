# Decrease Key

The decrease key operation in a binary min-heap is used to decrease the value of a specific node to a smaller value. In a min-heap, each node's value should be less than or equal to its children’s values. When we decrease a node’s value, we need to restore this property

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Identify the Node to Update

- Start with the node at index `i` where the key needs to be decreased. Update this node’s value to the new (smaller) value.

**Step 2**: Update the Node’s Value

- Set the node’s value at index i to the new, smaller value.

**Step 3**: Compare with Parent Node

- Check if the updated node’s new value is smaller than its parent’s value. If it is, the min-heap property has been violated, as the parent should not be larger than the child in a min-heap.

**Step 4**: Swap with Parent if Needed

- If the parent’s value is larger than the current node’s value, swap the two values to restore the min-heap property between these two nodes.

**Step 5**: Repeat Until the Min-Heap Property is Restored

- After swapping, move up to the parent node (now at index `parent(i)`) and repeat the comparison and swap process.
  - Continue this process until either:
    - You reach the root of the heap (index 0), or
    - The parent node’s value is smaller than or equal to the current node’s value, meaning the min-heap property is restored.

**Step 6**: End the Operation

- When the min-heap property is restored, the decrease key operation is complete.

## Implementation

```java
public void decreaseKey(int i, int value) {
    arr[i] = value;
    while (i != 0 && arr[parent(i)] > arr[i]) {
        swap(arr, i, parent(i));
        i = parent(i);
    }
}
```

# Delete

Following algorithm shows how to delete a node from a binary heap

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Decrease the Key

- Reduce the value of the element at index `i` (the element we want to delete) to a very low value (typically `Integer.MIN_VALUE`).
- By setting the element to the smallest possible value, we ensure that it will become the root of the heap after reordering.
- Use the `decreaseKey` method, which changes the value at index `i` to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and reorders the heap to maintain the min-heap (or max-heap) properties, ensuring that `Integer.MIN_VALUE` rises to the top of the heap.

**Step 2**: Extract the Root

- Remove the element at the root of the heap, which now contains the Integer.MIN_VALUE due to **Step 1**.
- Since `Integer.MIN_VALUE` is the smallest possible value in a min-heap, it will be at the root, and extracting the root effectively removes the element we wanted to delete.
- Use the extract method, which swaps the root with the last element in the heap, reduces the heap size by one, and performs a heapify operation starting from the root to maintain the heap structure.

## Implementation

```java
public void delete(int i) {
    decreaseKey(i, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    extract();
}
```

# Build Heap

The build heap algorithm is a method to transform an unsorted array into a heap structure, typically a min-heap or max-heap depending on the heapify logic. This process rearranges elements so that each subtree satisfies the heap property: in a min-heap, every parent node is smaller than or equal to its child nodes, and in a max-heap, every parent node is larger.

## Step-by-Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Identify Starting Point

- Begin with the non-leaf nodes of the tree, as leaf nodes are already heapified by default.
- The first bottom non-leaf node can be found at index `(size - 2) / 2`, where `size` is the total number of elements in the array.

**Step 2**: Iterate from Bottom Non-Leaf Node to Root

- Move upwards from the last non-leaf node to the root node, applying heapify on each node.
- This ensures that each subtree rooted at these nodes satisfies the heap property.

**Step 3**: Apply Heapify on Each Node

- For each node, call the `heapify` function to enforce the heap property:
  - If a node violates the heap property (e.g., in a min-heap, a parent node is larger than a child), swap it with the appropriate child.
  - Continue heapifying downwards (recursively or iteratively) on the swapped child until the subtree satisfies the heap order.

**Step 4**: Repeat Until All Nodes are Processed

- Continue heapifying until all non-leaf nodes, from the last one up to the root, have been processed.
- By the end of this step, the entire array will satisfy the heap property.

**Step 5**: Result

- After all nodes are processed, the array structure is transformed into a valid heap.
- The smallest element (or largest, in a max-heap) is now located at the root of the heap.

## Implementation

```java
public void buildHeap() {
    for (int i = (size - 2) / 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        heapify(i);
    }
}
```
