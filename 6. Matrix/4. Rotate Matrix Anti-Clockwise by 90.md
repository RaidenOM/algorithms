# Rotate Matrix Anti-Clockwise by 90
## Problem Statement
You are given a **square matrix** (NxN) and asked to **rotate it 90 degrees clockwise in place** — meaning you must modify the original matrix without using extra space for another matrix.

Eg:

    1 2 3      3 6 9
    4 5 6  =>  2 5 8
    7 8 9      1 4 7

## Key Idea
To rotate a matrix 90° clockwise **in-place**, you can decompose the transformation into two simpler operations:
1. **Transpose the matrix** — Convert rows into columns.
2. **Reverse each column** — Or, equivalently for clockwise rotation, **reverse all the rows of the transposed matrix**.

This transforms the matrix as desired without using extra space.
