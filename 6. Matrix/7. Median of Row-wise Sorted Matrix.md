# Median of Row-wise Sorted Matrix

## Problem Statement

Given a **row-wise sorted 2D matrix**, find the **median** of all elements in the matrix. The matrix is not necessarily sorted globally but each row is individually sorted.

## Key Idea

Use **binary search on the range of values** rather than the indices. For a candidate median value `mid`, you count how many elements in the matrix are **less than or equal to** `mid`. Depending on this count, adjust your binary search range. The median will be the **smallest number such that at least half the elements are less than or equal to it**.
