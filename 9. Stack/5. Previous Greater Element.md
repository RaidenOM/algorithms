# Previous Greater Element

The "Previous Greater Element" problem involves finding the nearest previous element that is greater than the current element in an array. For each element in the array, you want to find the most recent element to its left (if any) that is larger than it.

For example, if the array is `[10, 4, 2, 20, 40, 12, 30]`, the result for each element would be `[-1, 10, 4, -1, -1, 40, 40]`. If no greater previous element exists for an element, we return -1.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize a Stack

- This stack will store the indices of elements in the array. Using indices rather than the values directly allows us to access both the values and maintain their positions for comparison.

**Step 2**: Start with the First Element

- For the first element, there is no element to its left, so we print -1 as its "previous greater."
- Push the index of this element onto the stack.

**Step 3**: Iterate Over the Array Starting from the Second Element:

- For each element `arr[i]`, check the top of the stack:
  - **Pop Elements**: While the stack is not empty and the element at the top of the stack is less than or equal to `arr[i]`, pop elements from the stack. This step removes elements that are smaller or equal to `arr[i]`, as they can no longer be a "previous greater" for this element or any future elements.
  - **Determine Previous Greater**:
    - If the stack is empty after popping, it means there is no previous greater element for `arr[i]`, so we print -1. Otherwise, the top of the stack gives us the index of the previous greater element.
    - After the popping is done, the element currently at the top of the stack (if any) is the nearest previous greater element for `arr[i]`.

**Step 4**: Push the Current Index Onto the Stack

- This makes `arr[i]` the new candidate to be the "previous greater" for future elements, maintaining the decreasing order needed in the stack.

## Implementation

```java
public static void previousGreater(int[] arr) {
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    stack.push(0);  // Step 1: Push index 0 to start
    System.out.println(-1);  // Step 2: No previous greater for the first element

    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {  // Step 3: Start iterating from the second element
        // Step 4: Pop elements that are not greater than arr[i]
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && arr[stack.peek()] <= arr[i]) {
            stack.pop();
        }

        // Step 5: Determine and print the previous greater element
        int previousGreater = stack.isEmpty() ? -1 : arr[stack.peek()];
        System.out.println(previousGreater);

        // Step 6: Push the current index onto the stack
        stack.push(i);
    }
}
```
