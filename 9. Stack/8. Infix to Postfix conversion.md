# Infix to Postfix conversion

Infix notation is the typical way we write mathematical expressions (e.g., `A + B * C`). In postfix, operators follow their operands, which eliminates the need for parentheses and reduces the complexity of evaluating expressions (e.g., `A B C * +`).

Infix-to-Postfix Conversion transforms an expression from infix to postfix using a stack data structure to handle operators and respect operator precedence.

## Why it Works?

The stack helps manage operators in an order that respects their precedence and associativity. By using:

1. **Operator precedence**: Determines if one operator should be applied before another.
2. **Associativity**: Ensures operators of the same precedence level are handled correctly (left-to-right for most operators, but right-to-left for exponentiation).

This algorithm enables us to output operands in the order they appear while "holding" operators in the stack until they can be applied appropriately in postfix order.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize

- Use an empty stack to hold operators.
- Initialize an empty string to store the result (the postfix expression).

**Step 2**: Iterate through each character in the expression

- **Operand (e.g., A, B, 1, 2)**: Directly add the operand to the result.
- **Left Parenthesis `(`**: Push it onto the stack to mark the start of a subexpression.
- **Right Parenthesis `)`**: Pop operators from the stack and add them to the result until a left parenthesis `(` is encountered, which is then discarded (since its role in grouping is complete).
- **Operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`)**:
  - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack has an operator of higher precedence or the same precedence with left-associative operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), pop operators from the stack and add them to the result.
  - Push the current operator onto the stack.

**Step 3**: After the iteration ends

- Pop any remaining operators from the stack and add them to the result.

## Implementation

```java
// Returns precedence level of an operator
public static int precedence(char operator) {
    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
        case '-':
            return 1;
        case '*':
        case '/':
            return 2;
        case '^':
            return 3; // Exponent has the highest precedence
        default:
            return -1; // Non-operator characters
    }
}

// Function to convert infix expression to postfix
public static String infixToPostfix(String str) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    String result = "";

    // Traverse each character in the expression
    for (char x : str.toCharArray()) {
        // Case 1: If x is an operand (alphanumeric character), add it to the result
        if (Character.isLetterOrDigit(x)) {
            result += x;
        }

        // Case 2: If x is a left parenthesis, push it onto the stack
        else if (x == '(') {
            stack.push(x);
        }

        // Case 3: If x is a right parenthesis
        else if (x == ')') {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() != '(') {
                result += stack.pop();
            }
            stack.pop(); // Pop the left parenthesis '('
        }

        // Case 4: If x is an operator (+, -, *, /, ^)
        else {
            // Pop operators from the stack if they have higher or equal precedence with left associativity
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && precedence(stack.peek()) > precedence(x) ||
                   (precedence(stack.peek()) == precedence(x) && x != '^')) {
                result += stack.pop();
            }
            stack.push(x);
        }
    }

    // Pop all remaining operators in the stack
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        result += stack.pop();
    }

    return result;
}
```
