# Balanced Paranthesis determination

To determine if parentheses in a string are balanced:

1. Each opening parenthesis `(`, `{`, `[` must have a corresponding closing parenthesis `)`, `}`, `]`.
2. The parentheses must close in the correct order.

## Algorithm Explanation

We use a stack to keep track of the most recent opening parentheses. This lets us match each closing parenthesis in the correct order and ensure that all opening parentheses are closed.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize a Stack

- Create a stack stack to hold opening parentheses as they appear.

**Step 2**: Iterate through Each Character in the String

- Convert the input string into a character array to examine each character.

**Step 3**: For Each Character x

- If `x` is an Opening Parenthesis (`(, [, {`):
  - Push `x` onto the stack, which keeps track of unclosed parentheses.
- If `x` is a Closing Parenthesis (`), ], }`):
  - Check if the Stack is Empty:
    - If the stack is empty, it means there’s a closing parenthesis with no corresponding opening parenthesis, so return `false`.
  - Check if the Top of the Stack Matches the Closing Parenthesis:
    - Use `stack.peek()` to look at the top of the stack. If `x` matches the top of the stack as a closing match for an opening parenthesis:
      - Pop the top element off the stack (removing the matched opening parenthesis).
    - **Else, if it Doesn’t Match**:
      - If the closing parenthesis doesn’t match the opening one on the stack, return false, as the parentheses are not correctly nested.

**Step 4**: Final Check

- After iterating through the entire string, check if the stack is empty.
- If the stack is empty, return `true` (all opening parentheses were matched and closed).
- If the stack is not empty, return `false` (some opening parentheses were not closed).

## Implementation

```java
public static boolean balancedParanthesis(String s) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();  // Step 1: Initialize stack

    for (char x : s.toCharArray()) {  // Step 2: Iterate through each character in string
        if (x == '(' || x == '[' || x == '{') {
            // Step 3: If x is an opening parenthesis, push it to stack
            stack.push(x);
        } else if (x == ']' || x == '}' || x == ')') {
            // Step 4: If x is a closing parenthesis
            if (stack.isEmpty()) {
                return false;  // No opening parenthesis to match, so return false
            } else if ((x == ']' && stack.peek() == '[') ||
                       (x == ')' && stack.peek() == '(') ||
                       (x == '}' && stack.peek() == '{')) {
                // Step 5: If x matches the top of the stack, pop it (valid match)
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                // Step 6: If it doesn’t match, return false (invalid match)
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 7: If stack is empty, all parentheses were matched
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```
