# Fix BST with two nodes swapped

## How It Works

- A BST's in-order traversal produces a sorted sequence of node values.
- If two nodes are swapped, the sorted order will have **disruptions**, where a node appears in the wrong position relative to its neighbors.
- By performing an in-order traversal, we can identify these disruptions:
  - **First Node (`first`)**: The first node where the current node is less than the previous node in in-order traversal.
  - **Second Node (`second`)**: The node where the next disruption occurs (or the immediate smaller node after `first`).

Once these nodes are identified, their values can be swapped to fix the BST.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Variables Setup

- Use three global variables:
  - `previous`: Tracks the last visited node in the in-order traversal.
  - `first`: The first swapped node found.
  - `second`: The second swapped node found.

**Step 2**: In-Order Traversal

- Perform an in-order traversal of the BST. During traversal:
  1. For each node:
     - Check if it is less than the previous node.
     - If so, identify it as a swapped node:
       - The first disruption assigns previous to first and the current node to second.
       - On subsequent disruptions, only update second.
     - Update `previous` to the current node.
  2. Continue traversal recursively for left and right subtrees.

**Step 3**: Correct the Swapped Nodes

- Once traversal is complete, first and second contain the two swapped nodes.
- Swap their values to restore the BST's properties.

## Implementation

```java
static Node previous = null;
static Node first = null;
static Node second = null;

public static void fixBST(Node root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return;
    }

    // In-order traversal: Process the left subtree
    fixBST(root.left);

    // Check for swapped nodes
    if (previous != null && root.data < previous.data) {
        // If this is the first violation
        if (first == null) {
            first = previous; // First swapped node
        }
        // Always update the second node when a violation is found
        second = root;
    }
    previous = root; // Update the previous node

    // Process the right subtree
    fixBST(root.right);
}

public static void correctFoundNodes() {
    // Swap the values of the first and second nodes
    int temp = first.data;
    first.data = second.data;
    second.data = temp;
}
```
