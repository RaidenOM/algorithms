# Vertical Sum in Binary Tree

The goal of this algorithm is to calculate the sum of the nodes at each vertical level (or "line") of a binary tree. Vertical lines are defined based on the **horizontal distance** of nodes from the root. The algorithm uses a `TreeMap` to store sums for each horizontal distance.

## How It Works

1. Each node in a binary tree is assigned a **horizontal distance**:

   - The root has a horizontal distance of 0.
   - The left child of a node is at `horizontalDistance - 1`.
   - The right child of a node is at `horizontalDistance + 1`.

2. The algorithm uses recursion to traverse the tree and compute the sums at each horizontal distance:

   - For each node, it adds the node's value to the sum for the corresponding horizontal distance in the `TreeMap`.
   - Recursive calls are made for the left and right subtrees, adjusting the horizontal distance accordingly.

3. The `TreeMap` stores horizontal distances as keys and their corresponding sums as values. The map automatically sorts the keys (distances), making it easy to retrieve vertical sums in order.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Base Case

- If the current node (root) is `null`, return immediately (no further processing is needed).

**Step 2**: Recursive Traversal

- **Left Subtree**: Recursively call the function on the left child with `horizontalDistance - 1`.

- **Update Current Node's Contribution**:

  - Retrieve the current sum for this `horizontalDistance` from the TreeMap using `map.getOrDefault(horizontalDistance, 0)`.
  - Add the current node's value (`root.data`) to this sum and update the `TreeMap`.

- **Right Subtree**: Recursively call the function on the right child with `horizontalDistance + 1`.

**Step 3**: Result

- After the recursion completes, the `TreeMap` will contain the sums of all nodes grouped by their vertical lines.

## Implementation

```java
public static void verticalSum(Node root, TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map, int horizontalDistance) {
    // Base case: if the current node is null, return
    if (root == null)
        return;

    // Process the left subtree
    verticalSum(root.left, map, horizontalDistance - 1);

    // Add the current node's value to the map
    int currentSum = map.getOrDefault(horizontalDistance, 0); // Default to 0 if no value exists
    map.put(horizontalDistance, currentSum + root.data);

    // Process the right subtree
    verticalSum(root.right, map, horizontalDistance + 1);
}
```
