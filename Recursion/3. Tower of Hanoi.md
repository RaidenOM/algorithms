# Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem that involves moving `n` disks from one rod to another using a third rod as an auxiliary. The problem adheres to the following rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. All disks must be moved from the source rod to the destination rod.

## How it Works?

The recursive solution breaks the problem into smaller subproblems:

- Move the top `n − 1` disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod.
- Move the `n-th` (largest) disk directly from the source rod to the destination rod.
- Finally, move the `n − 1` disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod.

This process is repeated until `n = 0`, which is the base case.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Base Case

- If `n = 0`: No disks to move, so the function returns without doing anything.

**Step 2**: Recursive Case

- Move `n − 1` disks from the source rod (`A`) to the auxiliary rod (`B`) using the destination rod (`C`) as a helper.
- Move the `n-th` (largest) disk directly from the source rod (`A`) to the destination rod (`C`).
- Move the `n−1` disks from the auxiliary rod (`B`) to the destination rod (`C`) using the source rod (`A`) as a helper.

## Implementation

```java
public static void towerOfHanoi(int n, char A, char B, char C) {
    // Base case: No disks to move
    if (n == 0) {
        return;
    }

    // Step 1: Move n-1 disks from source (A) to auxiliary (B)
    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, A, C, B);

    // Step 2: Move the nth disk from source (A) to destination (C)
    System.out.println("Move disk " + n + " from " + A + " to " + C);

    // Step 3: Move n-1 disks from auxiliary (B) to destination (C)
    towerOfHanoi(n - 1, B, A, C);
}
```
