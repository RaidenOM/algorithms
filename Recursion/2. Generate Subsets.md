# Generate Subsets

This algorithm generates all possible subsets of a given string. Subsets are created by exploring two possibilities at every step: whether to include a character in the subset or exclude it. This approach ensures that every possible subset is eventually generated.

## How it Works?

The algorithm uses recursion to explore every combination of characters. Starting from the first character, it makes two recursive calls for each character:

1. **Do not include the character** in the current subset.
2. **Include the character** in the current subset.

By the time the recursion reaches the end of the string, the current subset is complete, and it is printed.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Base Case

- If the index `i` reaches the length of the string, it means all characters have been considered. At this point, the current subset currentcurrent is printed, and the function returns.

**Step 2**: Recursive Case

- For each character at index `i`:
  - **First Recursive Call**: Proceed to the next character without including the current character (currentcurrent remains unchanged).
  - **Second Recursive Call**: Include the current character in the subset (currentcurrent is updated by appending `str[i]`) and proceed to the next character.

**Step 3**: Exploration of Subsets

- This recursive process creates a binary tree of choices:
  - Each level corresponds to a character in the string.
  - Each node represents a choice to include or exclude a character.
  - The leaves of the tree represent complete subsets.

## Implementation

```java
public static void generateSubsets(String str, String current, int i) {
    // Base case: When all characters have been processed
    if (i == str.length()) {
        System.out.println(current); // Print the current subset
        return; // Terminate the current branch of recursion
    }

    // Recursive case: Exclude the current character
    generateSubsets(str, current, i + 1);

    // Recursive case: Include the current character
    generateSubsets(str, current + str.charAt(i), i + 1);
}
```
