# Rope Cutting Problem

The rope cutting problem is a recursive problem where we aim to determine the maximum number of pieces a rope of length nn can be cut into, given specific lengths aa, bb, and cc that each piece can have. If the rope cannot be cut into pieces of the specified lengths, the result is −1.

## How It Works

1. **Recursive Approach**:

   - The problem is solved recursively by reducing the rope's length nn by aa, bb, or cc at each step.
   - For each cut, we calculate the maximum pieces achievable after making that cut.
   - Base conditions handle edge cases, such as when the rope length becomes zero or negative.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem**:
   - If `n == 0`, it means we have successfully divided the rope, so we return 0 (no further cuts needed).
   - If `n < 0`, it means the current cutting approach is invalid, so we return −1.
   - For each possible cut, we recursively try all three lengths `a`, `b`, and `c`, and take the maximum result among them.
   - Add 1 to the result if a valid solution exists, as we've made one cut.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Base Cases

- If `n == 0`: This means the rope has been successfully divided into the required pieces, so return 0.
- If `n < 0`: This means it's impossible to cut the rope further in a valid way, so return −1.

**Step 2**: Recursive Cutting:

- For each recursive call:
  - Try reducing the rope's length by `a`, `b`, or `c`.
  - Calculate the maximum pieces possible by taking the maximum result among the three recursive calls.

**Step 3**: Check for Validity:

- If the result of all three recursive calls is −1, it means no valid cuts can be made for the given length, so return −1−1.
- Otherwise, add 1 to the result (to account for the current cut) and return it.

## Implementation

```java
public static int ropeCutting(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    // Base case: if the rope length is exactly zero, no further cuts are needed.
    if (n == 0)
        return 0;

    // Base case: if the rope length becomes negative, the cut is invalid.
    if (n < 0)
        return -1;

    // Recursive case: try cutting the rope by 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
    int res = Math.max(
        ropeCutting(n - a, a, b, c),
        Math.max(ropeCutting(n - b, a, b, c), ropeCutting(n - c, a, b, c))
    );

    // If no valid cuts are possible, return -1.
    if (res == -1)
        return -1;

    // Add 1 to the result to account for the current cut.
    return res + 1;
}
```

## Why it Works?

The algorithm works because:

- It explores all possible ways to cut the rope using recursion.
- It ensures invalid configurations are excluded by returning −1−1.
- It uses a simple base condition to handle the cases when the rope length is 0 or negative.
- By adding 1 for each valid cut, it keeps track of the total number of pieces efficiently.
