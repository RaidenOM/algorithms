# Level Order Traversal

## Key Idea

- The algorithm uses a queue (FIFO structure) to keep track of nodes yet to be visited:
  - Start by placing the root node in the queue.
  - Repeatedly remove the front node from the queue, visit it, and add its children (if any) to the queue.
  - This ensures nodes are visited level by level, since children are only added after their parent is processed.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize a Queue to hold the nodes of tree and enqueue the root node.

**Step 2**: Repeat the following steps while queue is not empty.

- **Dequeue**: Remove the front node. This is the current node
- **Process the current node**: Print the value or process the current node.
- **Enqueue its left child**: If the left child exists for the current node, enqueue it.
- **Enqueue its right child**: If the right child exists for the current node, enqueue it.

## Implementation

```java
public static void levelOrderTraversal(Node root) {
    if (root == null) {
        return;
    }

    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        Node current = queue.poll();
        System.out.println(current.data);
        if (current.left != null)
            queue.offer(current.left);
        if (current.right != null)
            queue.offer(current.right);
    }
}
```
