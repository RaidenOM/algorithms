# Level Order Traversal Line by Line

## Why the Algorithm Works

The algorithm for level-order traversal line by line leverages a queue to systematically visit nodes level by level in a breadth-first manner. Each iteration processes one level of the tree completely before moving on to the next level. The key idea is to use the size of the queue at the start of each loop to determine how many nodes belong to the current level. By doing so, it ensures nodes are printed line by line.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Handle Edge Case (Empty Tree)

- If the root node is `null`, the tree is empty, so thereâ€™s nothing to traverse. Simply return.

**Step 2**: Initialize a Queue

- Create a queue and add the root node to it. The queue will help keep track of nodes to process, ensuring that nodes at the current level are processed before moving to the next level.

**Step 3**: Process Levels Iteratively

- Use a `while` loop to process nodes level by level. The loop continues as long as there are nodes in the queue.

**Step 3**: Track the Current Level's Size

- Before processing a level, record the current size of the queue (`levelSize`). This value represents the number of nodes in the current level.

**Step 4**: Process All Nodes in the Current Level

- Use a `for` loop to iterate exactly `levelSize` times. In each iteration:
  - **Remove a Node**: Dequeue the front node from the queue.
  - **Print Node Data**: Print its value (or append it to a result for more structured output).
  - **Add Children to the Queue**:
    - If the dequeued node has a left child, enqueue it.
    - If the dequeued node has a right child, enqueue it.
- Once the loop ends, all nodes for that level are processed, and the next level is ready in the queue.

**Step 5**: Repeat for Each Level

- The outer `while` loop continues, processing the next level based on the updated queue contents.

**Step 6**: End the Traversal

- The algorithm terminates when the queue is empty, meaning all nodes in the tree have been visited.

## Implementation

```java
public static void levelOrderTraversalLineByLine(Node root) {
    // Handle the case of an empty tree
    if (root == null) {
        return;
    }

    // Initialize a queue for level-order traversal
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root); // Start with the root node

    // Loop until all levels are processed
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        // Determine the number of nodes at the current level
        int levelSize = queue.size();

        // Process all nodes at the current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            // Remove the front node from the queue
            Node current = queue.poll();

            // Print the current node's data
            System.out.print(current.data);

            // Enqueue the left child if it exists
            if (current.left != null) {
                queue.offer(current.left);
            }

            // Enqueue the right child if it exists
            if (current.right != null) {
                queue.offer(current.right);
            }
        }
        // Move to the next line after processing the current level
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```
