# Count nodes in a Complete Binary Tree

This algorithm leverages the fact that a complete binary tree has certain structural characteristics that can be used to optimize the counting process.

## Key Idea

- If the left and right subtrees of the root node have the same height, the tree is a full binary tree, and the number of nodes in that subtree can be calculated directly without recursively counting individual nodes.
- If the left and right subtrees do not have the same height but still is a complete binary tree, the function recursively counts the nodes in both the left and right subtrees.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Base Case (Null Root)

- If the root node is `null`, return 0 because an empty tree has no nodes.

**Step 2**: Calculate Left Height

- Traverse down the leftmost path of the tree (starting from the root) and count how many levels are there until you reach a leaf node or a `null` node. This gives the left height of the tree.
- Store this height in a variable, say `leftHeight`.

**Step 3**: Calculate Right Height

- Similarly, traverse down the rightmost path of the tree and count how many levels are there until you reach a leaf node or a null node. This gives the right height of the tree.
- Store this height in a variable, say `rightHeight`.

**Step 4**: Check if Left and Right Heights are Equal

- If the left and right heights are the same, it means the tree is full up to the last level, and the number of nodes can be determined directly.
- In a complete binary tree, if the left and right subtrees are of equal height, the subtree rooted at the current node is a perfect binary tree, meaning all levels are completely filled. The number of nodes in a perfect binary tree of height `h` is `2^h - 1`. So, return `(int) (Math.pow(2, leftHeight) - 1)` to calculate the total number of nodes in the complete binary tree.

**Step 5**: If Heights are Not Equal

- If the left and right heights are not the same, it means the tree is not full, and we need to recursively count the nodes in both the left and right subtrees.
- Call the function recursively on both the left and right subtrees, and add 1 to include the current root node.

## Implementation

```java
public static int countNodesInCompleteTree(Node root) {
    // Base case: if the tree is empty, return 0
    if (root == null) return 0;

    // Calculate the height of the leftmost path
    int leftHeight = 0;
    Node current = root;
    while (current != null) {
        leftHeight++;
        current = current.left;
    }

    // Calculate the height of the rightmost path
    int rightHeight = 0;
    current = root;
    while (current != null) {
        rightHeight++;
        current = current.right;
    }

    // If left and right heights are the same, it's a full binary tree
    if (leftHeight == rightHeight) {
        return (int) (Math.pow(2, leftHeight) - 1); // Formula for full binary tree
    } else {
        // Otherwise, count recursively for both subtrees
        return 1 + countNodesInCompleteTree(root.left) + countNodesInCompleteTree(root.right);
    }
}
```
