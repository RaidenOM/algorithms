# Print nodes at K distance

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: If the current node is `null`, return.

**Step 2**: If `k == 0`, that means we have reached the desired level.

- Print the value of the node
- return, since we don't need to traverse deeper

**Step 3**: If `k != 0`, that means `k` is greater than 0.

- Traverse deeper by calling the function on left and right subtree and reducing the value of k by 1.

## Implementation

```java
public static void printNodesAtKDistance(Node root, int k) {
    if (root == null)
        return;

    if (k == 0) {
        System.out.println(root.data);
        return;
    }

    printNodesAtKDistance(root.left, k - 1);
    printNodesAtKDistance(root.right, k - 1);
}
```
