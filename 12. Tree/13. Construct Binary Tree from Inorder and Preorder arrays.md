# Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Preorder arrays

To construct a binary tree from inorder and preorder traversal arrays, we rely on the properties of these traversal methods:

- **Preorder traversal**: visits the nodes in the order: root → left subtree → right subtree.
- **Inorder traversal**: visits the nodes in the order: left subtree → root → right subtree.

## Key Idea for Construction

The core idea is to leverage the fact that:

- The first element in the preorder array is always the root of the tree.
- The inorder array divides the tree into two parts: the left subtree (all nodes to the left of the root in the inorder array) and the right subtree (all nodes to the right of the root in the inorder array).

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Start with the Root

- The first element of the preorder array is always the root of the tree (or subtree). This is because preorder traversal visits the root first.

**Step 2**: Find the Root in the Inorder Array

- Once you know the root (from preorder), you can find this root in the inorder array.
- This position will divide the array into two parts:
  - **Left Subtree**: Elements to the left of the root in the inorder array.
  - **Right Subtree**: Elements to the right of the root in the inorder array.

**Step 3**: Recursively Construct Subtrees

- When reconstructing from preorder, always build the left subtree first, because preorder is consumed in root-left-right order, so the next node in preorder is guaranteed to be present in left of current node.
- For the left subtree, repeat the process using the left portion of the inorder array and the next elements from the preorder array.
- For the right subtree, use the right portion of the inorder array and the next elements from the preorder array.

**Step 4**: Base Case

- If the start index is greater than the end index (i.e., no nodes are left to process), return `null`. This serves as the base case for the recursion.

**Step 5**: Build the Tree

- For each recursive call, a new node is created (using the current root from the preorder array).
- After constructing the left and right subtrees recursively, assign them to the `left` and `right` properties of the current root node.

**Step 6**: Return the Root

- Once the subtrees have been built, the root node is returned, with its left and right subtrees correctly linked.

## Implementation

```java
static int preorderIndex = 0;

public static Node constructBinaryTree(int[] inorder, int[] preorder, int start, int end) {

    // Base case: if start index is greater than end, return null (no tree)
    if (start > end) {
        return null;
    }

    // The first element in preorder is the root of the current subtree
    Node root = new Node(preorder[preorderIndex++]);

    // Find the index of this root in the inorder array
    int inorderIndex = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < inorder.length; i++) {
        if (inorder[i] == preorder[preorderIndex]) {
            inorderIndex = i; // Found the root in inorder
        }
    }

    // Recursively build the left subtree (elements before the root in inorder)
    Node leftSubtree = constructBinaryTree(inorder, preorder, start, inorderIndex - 1);

    // Recursively build the right subtree (elements after the root in inorder)
    Node rightSubtree = constructBinaryTree(inorder, preorder, inorderIndex + 1, end);

    // Assign the left and right subtrees to the root
    root.left = leftSubtree;
    root.right = rightSubtree;

    // Return the root node of the subtree
    return root;
}
```
