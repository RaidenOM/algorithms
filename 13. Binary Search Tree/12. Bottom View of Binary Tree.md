# Bottom View of Binary Tree

The bottom view of a binary tree consists of the nodes that are visible when the tree is viewed from below. For each vertical line in the tree, the bottommost node will be part of the bottom view.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Horizontal Distance (HD)

- The root node is assigned a horizontal distance (HD) of 0.
  0 For the left child, the HD decreases by 1 (HD = parent HD - 1).
- For the right child, the HD increases by 1 (HD = parent HD + 1).

**Step 2**: Data Structure Setup

- Use a `TreeMap` to store the last node data at each horizontal distance. The keys represent horizontal distances, and the values represent the most recent node encountered at each HD.
- Use a **queue** for performing **level-order traversal** (Breadth-First Search). Each entry in the queue should be a `Pair` that stores:
  - A node.
  - Its corresponding horizontal distance.

**Step 3**: Perform Level-Order Traversal

- Initialize the queue with the root node and its corresponding horizontal distance (0).
- While the queue is not empty:
  - Dequeue a `Pair` that contains the current node and its horizontal distance.
  - Add the nodeâ€™s data to the `TreeMap` at the given horizontal distance. If a node with the same HD already exists, it will be replaced with the new node. This ensures that the bottommost node at each horizontal distance is recorded.
  - Enqueue the left and right children of the current node with updated horizontal distances (HD - 1 for the left child and HD + 1 for the right child).

**Step 4**: Output the Bottom View:

- Traverse the `TreeMap` in order of keys (i.e., in increasing horizontal distance).
- Print the values (node data) for each key, which correspond to the bottommost nodes at each horizontal distance.

## Implementation

```java
public static void bottomView(Node root) {
    if (root == null)
        return;

    // TreeMap to store the bottom view (last node at each horizontal distance)
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();

    // Queue for level-order traversal
    Queue<Pair> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(new Pair(root, 0)); // Initialize with root node and HD 0

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        // Dequeue a Pair
        Pair p = queue.poll();
        Node current = p.node;
        int horizontalDistance = p.horizontalDistance;

        // Update map with the current node (overwrite existing entry at same HD)
        map.put(horizontalDistance, current.data);

        // Enqueue left and right children with updated HDs
        if (current.left != null) {
            queue.offer(new Pair(current.left, horizontalDistance - 1));
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            queue.offer(new Pair(current.right, horizontalDistance + 1));
        }
    }

    // Traverse the TreeMap to print the bottom view
    for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : map.entrySet()) {
        System.out.println(entry.getValue());
    }
}
```
