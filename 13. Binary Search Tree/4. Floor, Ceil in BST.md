# Floor in BST

The floor of a value in a Binary Search Tree (BST) is the largest value in the tree that is less than or equal to the given value. The algorithm leverages the properties of the BST (left child < parent < right child) to efficiently find the floor.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize the Result

- Start with a variable `res` set to `null`. This variable will store the node representing the floor value as you traverse the tree.

**Step 2**: Traverse the BST

- Use a while loop to traverse the tree iteratively until you reach a null node.

**Step 3**: Check the Current Node's Value

- If the current node's value equals the given value:
  - This is the exact match, so it is also the floor. Return the current node immediately.

**Step 4**: Move to the Left Subtree

- If the current node's value is greater than the given value:
  - The floor cannot be in this node or its right subtree since all values in the right subtree will be even larger.
  - Move to the left child.

**Step 5**: Move to the Right Subtree and Update the Result

- If the current node's value is less than the given value:
  - The current node is a potential candidate for the floor since it is less than the value.
  - Update `res` to the current node.
  - Move to the right child to explore larger values that might still be less than or equal to the target value.

**Step 6**: Return the Result

- Once the traversal is complete, return the `res` node, which will hold the floor value or remain null if no floor exists.

## Implementation

```java
public static Node floor(Node root, int value) {
    if (root == null) // If the tree is empty, there is no floor
        return null;

    Node res = null; // Initialize result to null

    while (root != null) { // Traverse the tree
        if (root.data == value) {
            // If the exact value is found, it is the floor
            return root;
        } else if (root.data > value) {
            // If current value is greater, move to the left subtree
            root = root.left;
        } else {
            // If current value is smaller, it could be the floor
            res = root;
            root = root.right; // Check for closer candidates in the right subtree
        }
    }

    return res; // Return the final result
}
```

# Ceil in BST

The algorithm to find the ceil of a given value in a Binary Search Tree (BST) finds the smallest node in the BST whose value is greater than or equal to the given value. The method relies on the BST property: values in the left subtree are smaller than the root, and values in the right subtree are larger than the root.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize

- If the tree is empty (`root == null`), the ceil doesn't exist. Return `null`.
- Use a variable `res` to keep track of the current candidate for the ceil.

**Step 2**: Traverse the Tree

- Start from the root of the BST and traverse it iteratively.

**Step 3**: Case Analysis

- **Case 1**: If the current node's value equals the target value:
  - The current node is the ceil because it is exactly the value we are looking for. Return the current node.
- **Case 2**: If the current node's value is less than the target value:
  - The ceil must lie in the right subtree because all values in the left subtree and the current node are too small. Move to the right child (`root = root.right`).
- **Case 3**: If the current node's value is greater than the target value:
  - The current node is a potential ceil because it is greater than the target.
  - Save the current node in res.
  - Move to the left subtree (`root = root.left`) to check for smaller candidates.

**Step 4**: Return the Result

- If the traversal ends without finding an exact match, `res` will hold the smallest node greater than or equal to the target value.
- If no such node exists, `res` will remain `null`.

## Implementation

```java
public static Node ceil(Node root, int value) {
    if (root == null)
        return null; // Tree is empty

    Node res = null;

    while (root != null) {
        if (root.data == value) {
            // Exact match found
            return root;
        } else if (root.data < value) {
            // Current value is too small, move to the right subtree
            root = root.right;
        } else {
            // Current value is a potential ceil, move to the left subtree
            res = root;
            root = root.left;
        }
    }

    return res; // Return the smallest value >= target (or null if none found)
}
```
