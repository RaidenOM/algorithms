# Subset Sum Problem

The Subset Sum Problem determines the number of subsets in an array whose elements add up to a given sum. This algorithm uses recursion to explore all possible subsets of the array. At each recursive step, it either:

1. Includes the current element in the subset.
2. Does not include the current element in the subset.

By doing this, it exhaustively checks all combinations of elements in the array and counts the subsets whose sum equals the target value.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Base Case

- If there are no elements left in the array (`i == arr.length`), check if the remaining sum is 0.
  - If the sum is 0, increment the count of valid subsets.
- Return from the recursion.

**Step 2**: Recursive Steps

- **Do not include the Current Element**:
  - Call the function with the same sum but increase `i` by 1 (move to the next element).
- **Include the Current Element**:
  - Subtract the value of the current element from the sum.
  - Call the function again, increasing `i` by 1.

**Step 3**: Final Count

- After exploring all subsets, the global variable `count` contains the total number of subsets that match the target sum.

## Implementation

```java
static int count = 0;

public static void subsetSum(int[] arr, int n, int sum) {
    // Base case: no elements left
    if (i == arr.length) {
        if (sum == 0) {  // Check if the current subset sums to the target
            count++;     // Increment count of valid subsets
        }
        return;
    }

    // Recursive step: exclude the current element
    subsetSum(arr, i + 1, sum);

    // Recursive step: include the current element
    subsetSum(arr, i + 1, sum - arr[i]);
}
```
