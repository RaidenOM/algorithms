# Strongly Connected Components

Kosaraju’s Algorithm is a two-pass depth-first search (DFS) based method that identifies SCCs in directed graphs. An SCC is a maximal subgraph where each vertex can reach every other vertex within that subgraph. The Kosaraju’s algorithm leverages the fact that, in a graph, any two nodes in a strongly connected component are reachable from one another.

The algorithm operates in three main steps:

- **DFS to Record Finish Times:** First, it performs DFS on each node to record the order of completion times for each vertex.
- **Transpose (Reverse) the Graph**: By reversing the direction of all edges, we get a transposed graph where SCCs retain their connectivity properties.
- **DFS on Transposed Graph in Finish Time Order**: In the transposed graph, processing vertices in reverse of their finish time order from the original graph allows us to identify SCCs.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Store Finish Time Order (First DFS)

- Perform DFS on each vertex that hasn’t been visited.
- For each vertex, once all reachable nodes are visited, push the vertex onto a stack. This stack now represents nodes in increasing order of finish time (nodes that finish last are on top).

**Step 2**: Transpose the Graph

- Reverse the directions of all edges in the adjacency matrix representation of the graph.
- This step prepares the graph for the second DFS, which will identify SCCs.

**Step 3**: Perform DFS Based on Finish Time Order (Second DFS)

- Using the stack (which has nodes sorted by finish time), pop each node to process it.
- For each popped node, if it hasn’t been visited, initiate a DFS from it on the transposed graph. This DFS traversal will reach all nodes in the SCC that includes this node.
- Print or process all reachable nodes from this DFS traversal as an SCC.

## Implementation

```java
public static void kosarajus(int[][] graph, int vertices) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];
    Stack<Integer> finishTime = new Stack<>();

    // Step 1: Perform DFS on each vertex to store the vertices in order of their finish time
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            storeFinishTimeOrder(graph, vertices, i, visited, finishTime);
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Transpose the graph (reverse all edges)
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < vertices; j++) {
            int temp = graph[i][j];
            graph[i][j] = graph[j][i];
            graph[j][i] = temp;
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Process each vertex in the order defined by the finishTime stack
    // Reset visited array for second DFS on transposed graph
    Arrays.fill(visited, false);

    // Using the vertices in decreasing order of finish time
    while (!finishTime.isEmpty()) {
        int u = finishTime.pop();

        // If the node hasn’t been visited, it's the start of a new SCC
        if (!visited[u]) {
            System.out.print("SCC: ");
            dfs(graph, vertices, u, visited);
            System.out.println();  // Move to the next line after printing one SCC
        }
    }
}

// Helper method to perform DFS and record finish time of each vertex
public static void storeFinishTimeOrder(int[][] graph, int vertices, int u, boolean[] visited,
        Stack<Integer> finishTime) {
    visited[u] = true;
    for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
        if (graph[u][v] != 0 && !visited[v]) {
            storeFinishTimeOrder(graph, vertices, v, visited, finishTime);
        }
    }
    // All reachable nodes from u are processed, push u onto the stack
    finishTime.push(u);
}

// Helper method to perform DFS and print all vertices in the SCC
public static void dfs(int[][] graph, int vertices, int u, boolean[] visited) {
    visited[u] = true;
    System.out.print(u + " ");

    // Visit all adjacent nodes of u
    for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
        if (graph[u][v] != 0 && !visited[v]) {
            dfs(graph, vertices, v, visited);
        }
    }
}
```
