# Shortest Path Graph (Dijkstra's algorithm)

This is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from a given source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights. It maintains a `key` array to track the shortest distance from the source to each vertex as the algorithm progresses.

## Step by Step algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialization

- `spgSet[]`: A boolean array to keep track of vertices for which the shortest path has already been determined.
- `key[]`: An array to store the shortest distance from the source (vertex 0 in this case) to each vertex.
- Initialize all elements of `key[]` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, except for the source vertex `key[0]`, which is set to 0.

**Step 2**: Loop Through All Vertices

- For each vertex in the graph, the algorithm selects the vertex `u` with the smallest distance from the source, which has not been processed yet (i.e., `u` is not in `spgSet`).
- To find this vertex `u`, a helper function `selectMinWeightVertex()` is used to search through `key[]` for the minimum value among vertices that arenâ€™t yet in `spgSet`.
- We select the vertex with smallest distance first because:
  - When we reach a vertex `v` through the minimum distance, we already know there's no shorter path from the source to `v`.
  - This means the shortest distance to `v` is finalized as soon as we select it.

**Step 3**: Relaxation of Adjacent Vertices

- For each adjacent vertex v of u:
  - If vertex `v` has not been processed (`!spgSet[v]`) and there is an edge from `u` to `v` (`graph[u][v] != 0`), check if going through `u` gives a shorter path to `v`.
  - Specifically, if `key[v] > key[u] + graph[u][v]`, update key[v] with this new, lower value (`key[v] = key[u] + graph[u][v]`).

**Step 4**: Repeat Until All Vertices Are Processed

- The algorithm repeats this process until the shortest paths from the source to all reachable vertices are determined.

## Implementation

```java
public static void dijkstraSPG(int[][] graph, int vertices) {
        boolean[] spgSet = new boolean[vertices];
        int[] key = new int[vertices];

        Arrays.fill(key, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        key[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            int u = selectMinWeightVertex(key, spgSet, vertices);

            for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
                if (!spgSet[v] && graph[u][v] != 0 && key[v] > key[u] + graph[u][v]) {
                    key[v] = key[u] + graph[u][v];
                }
            }
        }

        //printing shortest distances from source
        System.out.println("Vertex \t Distance from Source");
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            System.out.println(i + " \t\t " + key[i]);
        }
    }

    public static int selectMinWeightVertex(int[] key, boolean[] mstSet, int vertices) {
        int minWeight = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int vertex = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            if (!mstSet[i] && key[i] < minWeight) {
                minWeight = key[i];
                vertex = i;
            }
        }
        return vertex;
    }
```
