# Bridges in Graph

Finding bridges in a graph is similar to finding articulation points. A bridge is an edge that, if removed, would increase the number of connected components in the graph. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown of the algorithm and an easy implementation for it.

## Key Concepts for Bridges

1.  **Discovery Time (`discoveryTime[u]`)**: Records when each node `u` is first visited during the DFS traversal.
2.  **Low Value (`low[u]`)**: The earliest visited node reachable from u or any of its descendants, accounting for back edges.

## Why It Works?

- If `low[v]` > `discoveryTime[u]` for an edge `(u, v)`, then `u` to `v` is a bridge because there is no other path (back edge or alternative path) for `v` to reach nodes visited before `u`.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Arrays

- `visited[]`: This is used to keep track of visited nodes, just for the sake of DFS.
- `discoveryTime[]`: Track discovery times for each node.
- `low[]`: Track the lowest discovery time reachable from each node.
- `parent[]`: Track parent nodes during DFS traversal (to avoid treating back edges as bridges).

**Step 2**: DFS Traversal

- For each unvisited node, start a DFS.
- Set the discovery time and low value for each node.

**Step 3**: Identify Bridges

- For each adjacent node `v` of a node `u`:
  - If `v` is not visited
    - Recursively apply DFS on `v`.
      - After returning from `v`, update `low[u]` as `low[u] = min(low[u], low[v])`.
      - Check if Edge is a Bridge: If `low[v] > disc[u]`, then `(u, v)` is a bridge. Print it.
  - If `v` is already visited and `v` is not the parent of `u`, update `low[u]` to `min(low[u], disc[v])`.

## Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BridgeFinder {

    static int time = 0;

    public static void findBridges(int[][] graph, int vertices) {
        int[] disc = new int[vertices];   // Discovery times of visited vertices
        int[] low = new int[vertices];    // Earliest visited vertices reachable
        int[] parent = new int[vertices]; // Parent vertices in DFS tree

        Arrays.fill(disc, -1);            // Initialize discovery times as unvisited
        Arrays.fill(low, -1);             // Initialize low values as unvisited
        Arrays.fill(parent, -1);          // No parent initially

        // DFS traversal to find bridges
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            if (disc[i] == -1) {
                dfs(graph, i, disc, low, parent, vertices);
            }
        }
    }

    private static void dfs(int[][] graph, int u, int[] disc, int[] low, int[] parent, int vertices) {
        disc[u] = low[u] = ++time;  // Initialize discovery time and low value for u

        for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
            if (graph[u][v] == 1) { // There's an edge between u and v
                if (disc[v] == -1) {  // If v is not visited
                    parent[v] = u;
                    dfs(graph, v, disc, low, parent, vertices);

                    // Check if the subtree rooted at v has a connection back to one of u's ancestors
                    low[u] = Math.min(low[u], low[v]);

                    // If the lowest reachable vertex from v is higher than discovery time of u, (u, v) is a bridge
                    if (low[v] > disc[u]) {
                        System.out.println("Bridge found: " + u + " - " + v);
                    }
                } else if (v != parent[u]) { // Update low value of u for back edge
                    low[u] = Math.min(low[u], disc[v]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
