# Articulation Point

Given undirected connected graph. Articulation points are nodes that, if removed, would increase the number of connected components in the graph, essentially "cutting" the graph into separate pieces.

To find these points, the algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) along with some additional logic:

## Step by Step algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Arrays

- We need arrays to keep track of:
  - **Visited Array (`visited[]`)**: This is used to keep track of visited nodes, just for the sake of DFS.
  - **Discovery Time (`disc[]`)**: The time when each vertex is first visited.
  - **Lowest Reachable Time (`low[]`)**: The earliest visited vertex that can be reached from the subtree rooted at the vertex.
  - **Parent (`parent[]`)**: To track the parent of each vertex in DFS.
  - **Articulation Points (`articulationPoints[]`)**: A boolean array to mark articulation points.

**Step 2**: Run DFS

- Start DFS from an arbitrary vertex and assign discovery times as you visit each vertex.
- As you move through each vertex, record both its discovery time and lowest reachable time.

Update Lowest Reachable Time:

**Step 3**: For each child vertex of the current vertex

- If the child hasn’t been visited:
  - Continue DFS on it and update the current vertex’s `low[]` based on the child’s `low[]`.
  - Check for Articulation Conditions:
    - **Root Condition**: If the current vertex is the root of DFS and has two or more children, it’s an articulation point.
    - **Bridge Condition**: If the current vertex is not the root and has a child for which no ancestor of the current vertex is reachable from that child (i.e., `low[child] >= disc[current]`), it’s an articulation point.
- If the child is already visited and isn’t the parent of the current vertex:
  - Update `low[]` of the current vertex based on the child’s discovery time (indicating a back edge).

**Step 4**: Output Articulation Points

- After finishing DFS, any vertex marked as true in the `articulationPoints[]` array is an articulation point.

## Implementation

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ArticulationPoints {

    static int time = 0;  // Global timer used to assign discovery times

    public static void findArticulationPoints(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph, int vertices) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];       // Track visited vertices
        int[] discoveryTime = new int[vertices];         // Discovery times of visited vertices
        int[] low = new int[vertices];                   // Lowest discovery time reachable
        int[] parent = new int[vertices];                // Parent vertices in DFS tree
        boolean[] articulationPoints = new boolean[vertices]; // To mark articulation points

        Arrays.fill(parent, -1); // Initialize parent array as -1 for all vertices

        // Run DFS for each unvisited vertex (handles disconnected components)
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                dfs(i, visited, discoveryTime, low, parent, articulationPoints, graph);
            }
        }

        // Print all articulation points
        System.out.println("Articulation Points:");
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            if (articulationPoints[i]) {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
        }
    }

    // Recursive DFS function to find articulation points
    private static void dfs(int u, boolean[] visited, int[] discoveryTime, int[] low, int[] parent, boolean[] articulationPoints, ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph) {
        visited[u] = true;
        discoveryTime[u] = low[u] = ++time;
        int children = 0; // Track the number of children in DFS tree

        // Visit all adjacent vertices
        for (int v : graph.get(u)) {
            if (!visited[v]) { // v is an unvisited child of u
                parent[v] = u;
                children++;

                // Recur for the child vertex
                dfs(v, visited, discoveryTime, low, parent, articulationPoints, graph);

                // Check if the subtree rooted at v has a connection back to an ancestor of u
                low[u] = Math.min(low[u], low[v]);

                // Condition 1: u is a root and has more than one child
                if (parent[u] == -1 && children > 1) {
                    articulationPoints[u] = true;
                }

                // Condition 2: u is not a root and low[v] >= discoveryTime[u]
                if (parent[u] != -1 && low[v] >= discoveryTime[u]) {
                    articulationPoints[u] = true;
                }
            } else if (v != parent[u]) { // Update low[u] if v is an already visited ancestor (back edge)
                low[u] = Math.min(low[u], discoveryTime[v]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
