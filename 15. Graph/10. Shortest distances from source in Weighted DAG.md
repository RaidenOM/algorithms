# Shortest distances from source in Weighted DAG

We make use of Topological sorting to find the shortest distances because then we would be accessing every vertex only after all jobs on which the current node depends has been processed

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Distance Array

- Create a distance array to store the shortest distance from the source to each vertex.
- Set the distance of the source vertex to 0 and all other vertices to infinity (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`) as we will be minimizing the distances.

**Step 2**: Set distance of source vertex

- Set distance of source vertex from source to 0
- `distance[source] = 0`

**Step 3**: Find the topological sort of the graph

**Step 4**: Process Each Vertex in Topological Order

- For each vertex u in topological order:
  - For each edge `(u, v)` leading to an adjacent vertex `v` with weight `w`, check if the distance to `v` can be minimized by going through `u`.
  - Update the distance of v if distance[u] + w is less than the current distance[v].

**Step 5**: Repeat Until All Vertices in the Order are Processed

- Continue processing each vertex as per the topological order until all vertices are processed. This guarantees that all shortest paths are calculated correctly for every reachable vertex from the source.

**Step 6**: Return the Distance Array

- After processing all vertices, the distance array holds the shortest path from the source to each vertex in the DAG.

## Implementation

```java
public static int[] shortestDistancesFromSourceDAG(ArrayList<ArrayList<Edge>> adj, int vertices, int source) {
    // finding the topological sort
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    int[] indegree = new int[vertices];

    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        for (Edge x : adj.get(i)) {
            indegree[x.destination]++;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] == 0) {
            queue.offer(i);
        }
    }

    // initialzing the distance array to MAX_VALUE
    int[] distance = new int[vertices];
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        distance[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    }
    distance[source] = 0;

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        int u = queue.poll();

        // for every adjecent edge of dequeued vertex
        for (Edge e : adj.get(u)) {
            // if distance of adjecent vertex is greater than distance of current vertex +
            // weight from source, update it
            if (distance[e.destination] > distance[u] + e.weight) {
                distance[e.destination] = distance[u] + e.weight;
            }

            // regular topological logic
            indegree[e.destination]--;
            if (indegree[e.destination] == 0) {
                queue.offer(e.destination);
            }
        }
    }
    return distance;
}
```
