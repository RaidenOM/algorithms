# Strongly Connected Components (Tarjan's algorithm)

Tarjan's Algorithm is a method for finding strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph in one DFS traversal. A strongly connected component is a subset of vertices where each vertex can reach every other vertex in that subset.

## Key Concepts

1. **Discovery Time**: This is the time when each vertex is first visited.
2. **Low Link Value**: The smallest discovery time reachable from a vertex, including itself and all its descendants in the DFS tree.
3. **Stack Maintenance**: Vertices are pushed onto a stack as they’re visited. When a complete SCC is found, it is popped off the stack.

## Why It Works

The algorithm uses DFS traversal to explore the graph while keeping track of discovery times and low-link values. If a vertex’s low-link value is equal to its discovery time, it means it’s the "root" of an SCC, and all vertices on the stack up to that root form the SCC.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Arrays and Stack

- `visited[]`: This is used to keep track of visited nodes, just for the sake of DFS.
- `discovery[]`: Stores discovery times of each vertex.
- `low[]`: Stores the lowest discovery time reachable from each vertex.
- `stack[]`: Vertices are pushed as they are visited

**Step 2**: DFS Traversal

- For each unvisited vertex, start a DFS.
- Set discovery time and low-link values.
- Push the vertex onto a stack.

**Step 3**: Update Low Link

- For each neighbor of the vertex:
  - If it hasn’t been visited, recurse on it, and update the low-link value of the current vertex based on the child.
  - If it’s already on the stack, update the low-link value of the current vertex based on that neighbor’s discovery time (indicating a back edge).

**Step 4**: Identify an SCC

- If a vertex’s low-link value equals its discovery time, it’s the root of an SCC.
- Pop vertices off the stack until reaching this root, and print/store them as an SCC.

## Implementation

```java
public class TarjanSCC {
    private static int time = 0; // Global timestamp for discovery times

    public static void tarjan(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph, int vertices) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices]; // Track if nodes have been visited
        int[] discoveryTime = new int[vertices]; // Stores discovery times
        int[] low = new int[vertices]; // Stores low-link values
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>(); // Stack to store nodes in the current SCC path

        // Initialize all nodes
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) { // Start DFS for each unvisited node
                dfs(graph, vertices, i, visited, discoveryTime, low, stack);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void dfs(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> graph, int vertices, int u, boolean[] visited, int[] discoveryTime, int[] low, Stack<Integer> stack) {
        visited[u] = true; // Mark the current node as visited
        discoveryTime[u] = low[u] = ++time; // Initialize discovery time and low-link value
        stack.push(u); // Push the node onto the stack

        // Visit all adjacent nodes of u
        for (int v : graph.get(u)) {
            if (!visited[v]) { // If v is not visited, recurse on it
                dfs(graph, vertices, v, visited, discoveryTime, low, stack);

                // After returning, update low-link value of u
                low[u] = Math.min(low[u], low[v]);
            } else if (stack.contains(v)) { // If v is in the stack, update low[u]
                low[u] = Math.min(low[u], discoveryTime[v]);
            }
        }

        // If u is a root of an SCC, pop all nodes till u from the stack
        if (low[u] == discoveryTime[u]) {
            int w;
            do {
                w = stack.pop();
                System.out.print(w + " "); // Print nodes in the current SCC
            } while (u != w);
            System.out.println(); // New line for each SCC
        }
    }
}
```
