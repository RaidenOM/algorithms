# Topological Sorting

Topological sorting is an ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge `u â†’ v` which implies vertex `v` has dependency on `u` where `u` is a job, vertex `u` is processed first in the ordering.

This type of ordering is useful in scenarios like task scheduling, where some tasks must be completed before others.

# 1. BFS Based Approach

The idea behind this approach, commonly known as Kahn's Algorithm, is to exploit the in-degree of vertices:

- In-degree refers to the number of edges directed into a vertex. If a vertex has no incoming edges (in-degree = 0), it has no dependencies, and can be processed (or "sorted") immediately.
- The key observation is that when processing a vertex, its adjacent vertices (dependencies) may have their in-degrees reduced because one of their dependencies has now been processed.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Calculate In-degrees

- For each vertex in the graph, calculate the in-degree, which is the number of edges directed into the vertex.
- This in-degree array will help identify vertices with no dependencies (in-degree of 0) to process them first.

**Step 2**: Initialize the Queue

- Initialize an empty queue and enqueue all vertices with an in-degree of 0. These are vertices that have no dependencies and can be processed immediately.

**Step 3**: Process Vertices in the Queue

- While the queue is not empty:
  - Dequeue a vertex `u` from the queue and add process it (this vertex has no remaining dependencies).
  - For each adjacent vertex `x` of `u`:
    - Decrease the in-degree of `x` by 1 because `u` has now been processed.
    - If `x` in-degree becomes 0, enqueue `x` (as it now has no dependencies left).

**Step 4**: Repeat Until All Vertices Are Processed

- Continue processing vertices from the queue until the queue is empty. Each dequeued vertex is part of the topological ordering.

## Implementation

```java
public static void topologicalSortingBFS(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int vertices) {
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    int[] indegree = new int[vertices];

    // Calculating indegree
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        for (int x : adj.get(i)) {
            indegree[x]++;
        }
    }

    // Adding all nodes to queue whose indegree is 0
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] == 0) {
            queue.offer(i);
        }
    }

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        // Enqueue a node and print it
        int u = queue.poll();
        System.out.println(u);

        // Explore its adjecents and decrement their indegree by 1
        // If indegree of any adjecent becomes 0, enqueue it
        for (int x : adj.get(u)) {
            indegree[x]--;
            if (indegree[x] == 0) {
                queue.offer(x);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# 2. DFS Based Approach

In topological sorting using Depth-First Search (DFS), we exploit the properties of DFS traversal to achieve the ordering:

- As we traverse each node, we mark it as visited and recursively explore its adjacent nodes.
- Once all the adjacent nodes are processed (i.e., all descendants in the DFS tree are processed), we push the current node onto a stack.
- After the DFS traversal is complete, the nodes in the stack represent the topologically sorted order (but in reverse), so we pop from the stack to get the correct order.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Structures

- We need a visited array to keep track of which nodes have been visited during the DFS traversal.
- We also need a stack to store the nodes in reverse topological order.

**Step 2**: Traverse Each Node

- Start with the first node in the graph.
- If the node has not been visited yet, initiate a DFS from that node.

**Step 3**: Depth-First Search (DFS)

- For the current node `u`:
  - Mark the node as visited.
  - Explore all its adjacent (neighboring) nodes that have not been visited yet. This is done recursively, diving deeper into the graph.

**Step 4**: Post-DFS Action

- Once all the adjacent nodes (children in the DFS tree) of the current node `u` have been fully explored (i.e., there are no unvisited adjacent nodes left), push node `u` onto the stack. This ensures that `u` appears after all of its descendants in the final topological order.

**Step 5**: Repeat for All Unvisited Nodes

- The DFS is performed for every unvisited node. If there are multiple disconnected components in the graph, the DFS will initiate from each unvisited node.

**Step 6**: Construct the Topological Sort

- Once all the nodes are processed, the stack will contain the nodes in reverse topological order.
- Pop all nodes from the stack and print them one by one. This gives the correct topological sorting of the graph.

**Step 7**: Output the Sorted Order

- After popping all elements from the stack, you have your final topological order.

## Implementation

```java
public static void topologicalSortingDFSRecursive(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int u, boolean[] visited, Stack<Integer> stack) {
    //mark current node as visited
    visited[u] = true;

    //recur for adjecent nodes if not visited
    for (int x : adj.get(u)) {
        if (!visited[x]) {
            topologicalSortingDFSRecursive(adj, x, visited, stack);
        }
    }

    //all adjecents have been explored so push current node to stack
    stack.push(u);

}

public static void topologicalSortingDFS(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int vertices) {
    //initialize a stack and visited array
    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];

    //call the recursive function for every node if not visited
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            topologicalSortingDFSRecursive(adj, i, visited, stack);
        }
    }

    //popping from the stack will give correct topological order
    while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
        System.out.println(stack.pop());
    }
}
```
