# Shortest Path Graph (Bellman Ford's algorithm)

The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford can handle graphs with negative edge weights (as long as there are no negative weight cycles that are reachable from the source). This makes it especially useful for situations where costs or distances might have negative values.

## How Bellman Ford works

Bellman-Ford operates by "relaxing" all edges in the graph multiple times, gradually finding the shortest path to each vertex. The main steps of the algorithm are:

1. **Initialization**: Start by setting the distance to the source vertex as 0 and all other vertices as infinity (or a very large number). This is because initially, we only know the source’s distance, and everything else is unknown.

2. **Relaxation**: Go through each edge and update the shortest known distance to each vertex. This step is repeated V - 1 times, where V is the number of vertices, because in the worst case, the shortest path between two vertices has V - 1 edges.

3. **Check for Negative Cycles**: After relaxing all edges V - 1 times, we go through all edges once more. If any edge can still be relaxed, it means there’s a negative weight cycle in the graph (reachable from the source). This is a cycle where the total weight is negative, causing the path’s total weight to decrease indefinitely.

## Why Bellman Ford works

The reason Bellman-Ford works is due to its systematic relaxation of edges. Each relaxation ensures that, if there’s a shorter path to a vertex through an edge, we update that path’s distance. Since the longest possible path without cycles between two vertices can have at most V - 1 edges, relaxing all edges V - 1 times guarantees that all shortest paths will be found.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Distances

- Set the source vertex distance to 0 and all others to infinity.

**Step 2**: Relax Edges Repeatedly

- For each vertex, iterate through all edges.
- For each edge `(u, v)` with weight `w`, if the distance to `u` is not infinity (i.e. `u` has been connected to source) and the distance to `u` plus `w` is less than the current distance to `v`, update the distance to `v`.

**Step 3**: Check for Negative Cycles

- Go through all edges one more time. If any edge can still relax (i.e., it provides a shorter path), then a negative weight cycle exists.

## Implementation

```java
public static void bellmanFord(int[][] graph, int vertices, int source) {
    int[] distance = new int[vertices];
    Arrays.fill(distance, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    distance[source] = 0;

    // Step 2: Relax all edges (V - 1) times
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices - 1; i++) {
        for (int u = 0; u < vertices; u++) {
            for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
                if (graph[u][v] != 0 && distance[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE &&
                    distance[u] + graph[u][v] < distance[v]) {
                    distance[v] = distance[u] + graph[u][v];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Check for negative weight cycles
    for (int u = 0; u < vertices; u++) {
        for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
            if (graph[u][v] != 0 && distance[u] != Integer.MAX_VALUE &&
                distance[u] + graph[u][v] < distance[v]) {
                System.out.println("Graph contains a negative weight cycle.");
                return;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print the calculated shortest distances
    System.out.println("Vertex\tDistance from Source");
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        System.out.println(i + "\t" + distance[i]);
    }
}
```
