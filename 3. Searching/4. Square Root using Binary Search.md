# Square Root using Binary Search

## Key Idea

In this algorithm we use binary search to find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to a given number.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize search range

- Set `low = 1` and `high = x`.

(We start at 1 because square root of 0 or 1 is trivial and can be handled separately.)

**Step 2**: Binary Search Loop

- While `low` is less than or equal to `high`, repeat:
  - Calculate the middle value: `mid = (low + high) / 2`.

**Step 3**: Check if `mid` is the square root

- If `mid * mid == x`, then `mid` is the exact square root â€” return it.

**Step 4**: If square of `mid` is greater

- If `mid * mid > x`, the square is too large.
- So discard the right half by setting `high = mid - 1`.

**Step 5**: If square of `mid` is smaller

- If `mid * mid < x`, then `mid` is a candidate but not large enough.
- Update `ans = mid` (store it as a possible result).
- Move search to the right half: set `low = mid + 1`.

**Step 6**: Return final answer

- When loop ends, `ans` will contain the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to given number.

## Implementation

```java
public static int squareRoot(int x) {
    int low = 1;
    int high = x;
    int ans = -1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (mid * mid == x) {
            return mid;
        } else if (mid * mid > x)
            high = mid - 1;
        else {
            ans = mid;
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return ans;
}
```
