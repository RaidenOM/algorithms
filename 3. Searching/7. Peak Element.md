# Peak Element

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr` of size `n`. Your task is to find any one peak element in the array.

A peak element is defined as an element that is not smaller than its neighbors. For element `arr[i]`, this means:

- `arr[i] >= arr[i - 1]` (if `i > 0`)
- `arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]` (if `i < n - 1`)

Your goal is to return the index of any such peak element.

## Key Algorithm

The algorithm finds a **peak element** in an array using binary search.
A **peak element** is one that is **not smaller than its neighbors** (either greater than or equal to both left and right).
This method does not require the array to be sorted. This method utilizes the fact that for any element, **if it is smaller than it's left neighbour the peak will be on left otherwise right.**

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Search Bounds:

- Set `low = 0` and `high = n - 1` (start and end of the array).

**Step 2**: Loop until `low` is less than or equal to `high`:

- Calculate the middle index `mid = (low + high) / 2`.

**Step 3**: Check if `arr[mid]` is a Peak:

- A peak satisfies:
  - It is the first element or `arr[mid] >= arr[mid - 1]`
  - It is the last element or `arr[mid] >= arr[mid + 1]`
- If `true`, return `mid` as the index of the peak.

**Step 4**: If Left Neighbor is Greater:

- If `arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]`, move search to the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.
- This ensures we are searching in the direction where a peak is more likely.

**Step 5**: Else, Search in the Right Half:

- If `arr[mid + 1] > arr[mid]`, set `low = mid + 1`.

**Step 6**: Repeat Until a Peak is Found:

- Eventually, the loop will converge to a peak element.

**Step 7**: Return `-1` if No Peak Found (edge case):

- Though in a valid input, a peak always exists, this return is a fallback.

## Implementation

```java
public static int peakElement(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int low = 0;
    int high = n - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if ((mid == 0 || arr[mid] >= arr[mid - 1]) && (mid == n - 1 || arr[mid] >= arr[mid + 1])) {
            return mid;
        } else if (mid > 0 && arr[mid] <= arr[mid - 1]) {
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```
