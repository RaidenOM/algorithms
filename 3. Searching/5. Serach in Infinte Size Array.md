# Serach in Infinte Size Array

## Key Idea

Use **exponential search** to quickly find a range (`low`, `high`) where the key might exist, then use **binary search** within that range to locate the exact position of the key.

This is efficient because:

- **Exponential search** increases the range exponentially, so it reaches the target range quickly.
- **Binary search** is efficient once the range is found, with O(log n) complexity.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Check First Element:

- If the key matches the first element in the array, return index 0 immediately.

**Step 2**: Exponential Expansion:

- Start with `high = 1`.
- Repeatedly double the high index (i.e., `1, 2, 4, 8, 16,...`) until the value at that index is greater than or equal to the key.

**Step 3**: Check High Index:

- If the value at the current `high` index equals the key, return that index.

**Step 4**: Define Search Range:

- Set `low` to just after the previous high value (`high / 2 + 1`).
- Set `high` as found in the exponential step.

**Step 5**: Binary Search:

- Perform a binary search between `low` and `high` to locate the key and return its index.

## Implementation

```java
public static int searchInInfinite(int[] arr, int key) {
    if (arr[0] == key)
        return 0;

    int high = 1;
    while (arr[high] < key) {
        high *= 2;
    }

    if (arr[high] == key)
        return high;

    int low = high / 2 + 1;
    return binarySearch(arr, key, low, high);
}
```
