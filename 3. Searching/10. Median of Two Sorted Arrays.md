# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Key Idea

The algorithm uses a **binary search** on the shorter array to find the correct partition between the two arrays such that:

- The **left half** contains the first half of the total elements,
- The **right half** contains the rest,
- And all elements in the left half are ≤ all elements in the right half.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Ensure A is the Smaller Array

- If array A is longer than B, the function swaps them.
- Binary search is applied only on the smaller array to optimize performance and handle edge cases easily.

**Step 2**: Initialize Search Bounds

- Set `low = 0` and `high = A.length - 1`.
- The goal is to find a partition of the combined arrays such that:
  - Left side has `half = (n + m) / 2` elements.
  - Right side has the remaining elements.

**Step 3**: Binary Search Loop

- In each iteration:
  - Choose partition index `i` in A using binary search.
  - Compute corresponding partition index `j` in B such that left side gets half elements.

**Step 4**: Determine Partition Values

- Define four boundary values:
  - `ALeft`: last element on left of A's partition.
  - `ARight`: first element on right of A's partition.
  - `BLeft`: last element on left of B's partition.
  - `BRight`: first element on right of B's partition.
- Use `±Infinity` when the partition is at the edge of the array to avoid out-of-bound errors.

**Step 5**: Check Correct Partition Condition

- If `ALeft ≤ BRight` and `BLeft ≤ ARight`, you’ve found the correct partition:
  - If the total length is **even**, median is the average of max of left elements and min of right elements.
  - If the total length is **odd**, median is the max of the left elements.

**Step 6**: Adjust Binary Search Range

- If `ARight < BLeft`, move search to the right (`low = i + 1`) — need bigger values on A’s left.
- If `ALeft > BRight`, move search to the left (`high = i - 1`) — need smaller values on A’s left.

**Step 7**: Return Result

- The correct median is returned once the right partition is found.

## Implementation

```java
public static double medianTwoSorted(int[] A, int[] B) {
    if (A.length > B.length)
        return medianTwoSorted(B, A);

    int n = A.length;
    int m = B.length;

    int total = n + m;
    int half = total / 2;

    int low = 0;
    int high = n - 1;

    while (low <= high) {
        int i = (low + high) / 2;
        int j = half - 2 - i;

        int ALeft = i >= 0 ? A[i] : Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int BLeft = j >= 0 ? B[j] : Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        int ARight = i < n - 1 ? A[i + 1] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int BRight = j < m - 1 ? B[j + 1] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        if (ALeft <= BRight && BLeft <= ARight) {
            if (total % 2 == 0) {
                return ((double) Math.max(ALeft, BLeft) + (double) Math.min(ARight, BRight)) / 2;
            } else {
                return Math.max(ALeft, BLeft);
            }
        } else if (ARight < BLeft) {
            low = i + 1;
        } else {
            high = i - 1;
        }

    }
    return -1;
}
```
