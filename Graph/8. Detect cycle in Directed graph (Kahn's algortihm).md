# Detect cycle in Directed graph (Kahn's algortihm)

The idea is to perform a modified version of topological sorting where the graph is processed in such a way that if we can't process all the nodes (i.e., some nodes still have non-zero indegrees), then there must be a cycle in the graph.

In topological sorting, each node should appear before all its neighbors. If we can't achieve this for all the nodes, it indicates that there's a circular dependency, which forms a cycle in the graph.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Create a variable `countOfProcessed` to keep track of processed nodes

**Step 2**: After enqueuing each node from the queue and processing it, increment the `countOfProcessed`

**Step 3**: If by the end of loop, `countOfProcessed != vertices`, this means there is a cycle because we were unable to process some nodes. Return `true` in this case

## Implementation

```java
public static boolean detectCycle(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int vertices) {
    //Standard Kahn's algorithm
    int[] indegree = new int[vertices];
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

    //Keeping track of processed nodes
    int countOfProcessed = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        for (int x : adj.get(i)) {
            indegree[x]++;
        }
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] == 0) {
            queue.offer(i);
        }
    }

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        //Dequeue, process, increment count of processed nodes
        int u = queue.poll();
        countOfProcessed++;
        for (int x : adj.get(u)) {
            indegree[x]--;
            if (indegree[x] == 0) {
                queue.offer(x);
            }
        }
    }


    return countOfProcessed != vertices;
}
```
