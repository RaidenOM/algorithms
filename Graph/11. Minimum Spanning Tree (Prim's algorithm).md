# Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's algorithm)

A spanning tree is a subset of the graph that connects all vertices together without forming any cycles.
In a spanning tree, there are exactly **V-1** edges, where **V** is the number of vertices.

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST):

- An MST is a spanning tree where the sum of the edge weights is minimized.

How this works:

- We first select a vertex usually 0.
- We pick the next adjecent vertex with the least weight
- We continue this till all vertices are reached. This creates an MST

## Step by Step algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Variables

- `key[]`: Stores the minimum weight required to include each vertex in the MST. Initially, all entries are set to infinity (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`), except for the starting vertex (vertex 0), which is set to 0.
  - This is done because we will be inserting node with minimum weight and we want to insert source first
- `mstSet[]`: This boolean array keeps track of vertices that have been added to the MST. Initially, all entries are false.
- `parent[]`: Stores the parent of each vertex in the MST. `parent[i]` will eventually represent the vertex that connects to `i` in the MST with the minimum weight.

**Step 2**: Iterate to Add Each Vertex to the MST

- For each vertex, use a helper method `selectMinWeightVertex` to pick the vertex not yet in `mstSet[]` with the smallest value in `key[]`.
- This vertex is added to the MST by marking `mstSet[u] = true`.

**Step 3**: Update Adjacent Vertices

- For the vertex `u`that was just added to the MST, check all other vertices (`v`):
  - If vertex `v` has not been added to the MST (`!mstSet[v]`)
  - There is an edge between `u` and `v` (`graph[u][v] != 0`)
  - This edge weight is less than the current `key[v]` value
    - Update `key[v]` to the weight of the edge between `u` and `v`.
    - Set `parent[v]` to `u`, showing that `u` is the parent of `v` in the MST.

**Step 4**: Print the MST

- After adding all vertices to the MST, print the edges and weights. Each entry in `parent[]` and `key[]` represents an edge in the MST: `parent[i] - i = key[i]`.

## Implementation

```java
public static void primsMST(int[][] graph, int vertices) {
    int[] key = new int[vertices];               // Minimum weights to reach each vertex
    boolean[] mstSet = new boolean[vertices];    // Track vertices added to MST
    int[] parent = new int[vertices];            // Store MST structure

    Arrays.fill(key, Integer.MAX_VALUE);         // Set all keys to max initially
    parent[0] = -1;                              // Starting node has no parent
    key[0] = 0;                                  // Start with vertex 0 (arbitrary)

    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        // Select vertex with minimum weight that is not in MST
        int u = selectMinWeightVertex(key, mstSet, vertices);
        mstSet[u] = true;                        // Add the selected vertex to MST

        // Update keys for adjacent vertices of u
        for (int v = 0; v < vertices; v++) {
            // Update key if:
            // 1. v is not in MST
            // 2. There is an edge from u to v
            // 3. This edge weight is smaller than key[v]
            if (!mstSet[v] && graph[u][v] != 0 && graph[u][v] < key[v]) {
                key[v] = graph[u][v];
                parent[v] = u;
            }
        }
    }

    // Print MST edges and weights
    for (int i = 1; i < vertices; i++) {
        System.out.println(parent[i] + " - " + i + " = " + key[i]);
    }
}

// Helper function to select the minimum weight vertex not yet in MST
public static int selectMinWeightVertex(int[] key, boolean[] mstSet, int vertices) {
    int minWeight = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int vertex = -1;
    for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
        if (!mstSet[i] && key[i] < minWeight) {
            minWeight = key[i];
            vertex = i;
        }
    }
    return vertex;
}

```
