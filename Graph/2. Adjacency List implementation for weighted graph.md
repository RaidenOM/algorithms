# Adjacency List implementation for weighted graph

To implement a weighted graph using an adjacency list, follow these steps:

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Choose a Data Structure to Represent Each Edge with Weight

- Since each edge has a weight, use a pair structure to store both the neighboring vertex and the weight of the edge.
- A simple way is to use a class or a pair-like structure that holds two values: the destination vertex and the weight.

**Step 2**: Initialize the Adjacency List

- Use an ArrayList of ArrayLists, where each ArrayList at index i represents the list of edges originating from vertex i.
- Each list will store pairs, with each pair representing an edge going to a neighboring vertex and its weight.

**Step 3**: Add Edges to the Adjacency List

- For each edge `(u, v, w)`, where `u` is the starting vertex, `v` is the ending vertex, and `w` is the weight:
  - Add a pair `(v, w)` to the adjacency list of vertex `u`.
  - If the graph is undirected, also add the reverse edge `(u, w)` to the adjacency list of vertex `v`.

**Step 4**: Accessing the Graph

- To view all neighbors of a vertex u, simply iterate through u's adjacency list.
- Each item in this list will provide a neighbor and the weight of the edge leading to it.

## Example Walkthrough

**1. Define an Edge Pair Structure**

```java
class Edge {
    int destination;
    int weight;
    Edge(int destination, int weight) {
        this.destination = destination;
        this.weight = weight;
    }
}
```

**2. Initialize the Adjacency List for n Vertices**

```java
int n = 5;  // example number of vertices
ArrayList<ArrayList<Edge>> adjList = new ArrayList<>(n);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    adjList.add(new ArrayList<Edge>());
}
```

**3. Add Edges**

- For example, add an edge from vertex 0 to vertex 1 with weight 5, and from vertex 1 to vertex 2 with weight 3.

```java
// Add edge from vertex 0 to vertex 1 with weight 5
adjList.get(0).add(new Edge(1, 5));

// For undirected graph, also add reverse edge
adjList.get(1).add(new Edge(0, 5));

// Add edge from vertex 1 to vertex 2 with weight 3
adjList.get(1).add(new Edge(2, 3));

// Add reverse edge for undirected graph
adjList.get(2).add(new Edge(1, 3));
```

**4. Access and Display Neighbors**

- To display all edges for vertex u:

```java
int u = 1; // example vertex
for (Edge edge : adjList.get(u)) {
    System.out.println("Edge from " + u + " to " + edge.destination + " with weight " + edge.weight);
}
```
