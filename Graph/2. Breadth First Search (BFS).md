# Breadth First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Queue and Visited Array

- We start by creating a queue to manage the order in which vertices are processed.
- We also create a visited array to keep track of which vertices have already been visited to avoid revisiting nodes, preventing infinite loops in case of cycles.

**Step 2**: Enqueue Start Vertex and Mark it as Visited

- The BFS starts from a given vertex, startVertex.
- We mark `startVertex` as visited by setting `visited[startVertex] = true`.
- Then, we add `startVertex` to the queue to start the traversal.

**Step 3**: Process the Queue Until it is Empty

- BFS proceeds by exploring nodes in layers. We process each vertex one at a time by dequeuing from the front of the queue.
- While the queue is not empty:
  - **Dequeue the Front Vertex**: We remove the front vertex (letâ€™s call it `u`) from the queue. This vertex is now being visited, and we print it or perform any required operation.

**Step 4**: Explore Adjacent Vertices

- For each adjacent vertex of `u` (i.e., `x` in `adj.get(u)`):
  - Check if the vertex has been visited by looking at visited[x].
  - If x has not been visited:
    - Mark x as visited.
    - Enqueue x to ensure it gets processed in the future.

**Step 5**: Continue Until All Vertices in Reach are Processed

- Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the queue is empty. When the queue is empty, all reachable vertices from the starting vertex have been visited, and BFS is complete.

## Implementation

### 1. Simple BFS

```java
public static void BFS(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int vertices, int startVertex) {
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];

    //Enqueue the start vertex and mark it as visited
    queue.offer(startVertex);
    visited[startVertex] = true;

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        //Dequeue a vertex
        int u = queue.poll();
        System.out.print(u + " ");

        //Add its adjecents if not visited
        for (int x : adj.get(u)) {
            if (!visited[x]) {
                visited[x] = true;
                queue.offer(x);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. BFS for disconnected graph

```java
public static void BFS(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int startVertex, boolean[] visited) {
    Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();

    //Enqueue the start vertex and mark it as visited
    queue.offer(startVertex);
    visited[startVertex] = true;

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        //Dequeue a vertex
        int u = queue.poll();
        System.out.print(u + " ");

        //Add its adjecents if not visited
        for (int x : adj.get(u)) {
            if (!visited[x]) {
                visited[x] = true;
                queue.offer(x);
            }
        }
    }
}

//A function that calls the main function for every vertex and also passes the visited boolean array
public static void BFSDisconnected(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int vertices) {
    boolean[] visited = new boolean[vertices];
    for(int i=0; i < vertices; i++) {
        if(!visited[i]) {
            BFS(adj, i, visited);
        }
    }
}
```
