# Longest Consecutive Subsequence

## Key Idea

The key idea is to find the longest consecutive sequence (in terms of value, not index) in an unsorted array in linear time.
The optimization is:

- Only start counting a sequence from numbers that do not have a predecessor in the set (x - 1 not in set).
- This avoids redundant work, because otherwise you'd end up scanning the same sequence multiple times.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Create a hash set and add all the array elements to it.

- This allows constant-time lookup for any number.

**Step 2**: Initialize a variable `maxLength` to track the longest consecutive sequence found.

**Step 3**: Iterate through each element `x` in the array:

- Check if `x` is the start of a sequence by seeing if `x - 1` is not in the set. If it is, do not process `x` as it won't yield longest subsequence.
- If `x - 1` is not in the set, then `x` might be the beginning of a new sequence.
- Start expanding the sequence:
  - Initialize a counter `length = 1`.
  - Keep incrementing `x + 1`, `x + 2`, etc., while those numbers exist in the set.
  - For each found element, increase the length by `1`.
- Update `maxLength` if the current sequence is longer than the previous maximum.

**Step 4**: Return `maxLength` as the result after the loop.

## Implementation

```java
public int longestConsecutive(int[] arr) {
    HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
    int maxLength = 1;

    // seed set
    for(int x: arr) {
        set.add(x);
    }

    for(int x: arr) {
        if(!set.contains(x - 1)) {
            int number = x + 1;
            int length = 1;
            while(set.contains(number)) {
                length++;
                number++;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, length);
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}
```
