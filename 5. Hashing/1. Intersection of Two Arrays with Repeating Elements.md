# Intersection of Two Arrays with Repeating Elements

## Key Idea

The goal is to find the **intersection** of two integer arrays, where each element in the result appears as many times as it shows in both arrays. This means you're not just checking whether an element appears in both, but also how many times â€” and including it that many times in the result.

This approach uses a **hash map** to efficiently track counts of elements in one array, then compares it against the second array to collect matches.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Build a frequency map from the first array:

- Go through each number in the first array (`nums1`).
- Use a hash map to count how many times each number appears.

**Step 2**: Scan the second array and look for matches:

- Go through each number in the second array (`nums2`).
- For each number, check if it exists in the hash map **and** has a non-zero count.
- If so, add it to the result list and **decrease its count** in the map (to ensure correct frequency).

**Step 3**: Return the result:

- The list now contains the intersection elements, accounting for duplicates.
- Return this list as the final result.

## Implementation

```java
public ArrayList<Integer> intersect(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    for(int x: nums1) {
        map.put(x, map.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
    }

    ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
    for(int x: nums2) {
        if(map.containsKey(x) && map.get(x) != 0) {
            result.add(x);
            map.put(x, map.get(x) - 1);
        }
    }

    return result
}
```
