# Pair with Given Sum in Unsorted Array

## Key Idea

The goal is to determine whether **any two elements** in the array add up to a specific target sum. This algorithm uses a **HashSet** to keep track of elements we've seen so far, allowing us to check in constant time whether the complement (`sum - x`) of the current element has already been seen.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize an empty HashSet:

- This will store the elements you’ve iterated through.

**Step 2**: Iterate through the array:

- For each element `x`, calculate the complement needed to reach the target sum: `sum - x`.

**Step 3**: Check for the complement:

- If the complement exists in the set, then a valid pair has been found → return `true`.

**Step 4**: Add the current element to the set:

- If not found, add `x` to the set and move to the next number.

**Step 5**: Finish loop and return false:

- If no pair was found after checking all elements, return `false`.

## Implementation

```java
public static boolean pairWithGivenSum(int[] arr, int sum) {
    HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

    for (int x : arr) {
        if (set.contains(sum - x))
            return true;
        set.add(x);
    }
    return false;
}
```
