# Count Subarrays with Given Sum

## Key Idea

This algorithm is designed to **count the number of contiguous subarrays** whose elements sum up to a given value `k`. It leverages the concept of **prefix sums** and a **hash map** to efficiently track how many times each prefix sum has occurred.

The fundamental insight is:

- If the sum of elements from the start up to index `i` is `prefixSum`, and there's a previous prefix sum equal to `prefixSum - k`, then the subarray between that earlier `index + 1` and `j` has a sum of `k`.
- The count of subarrays that has sum equal to `prefixSum - k` is the number of subarrays which we can remove starting from first element to current element to get the required subarrays.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize:

- A variable to keep track of the running sum of elements as we iterate (`prefixSum`).
- A hash map to store how many times each prefix sum has occurred.
- Start by putting `0 â†’ 1` in the map, to handle subarrays that start from index `0` and sum to `k`.
- A counter to store the total number of valid subarrays found (`count`).

**Step 2**: Iterate through the array and for each element:

- Add it to the `prefixSum`.
- Check for a valid subarray:
  - Calculate `prefixSum - k`. This is the sum we want to have seen earlier.
  - If this value exists in the map, it means there are one or more subarrays ending at the current index whose sum is exactly `k`.
  - Add the number of times this earlier sum occurred (from the map) to `count`.
  - Record or update the frequency of the current `prefixSum` in the map.

**Step 3**: After finishing the array:

- The `count` will contain the total number of contiguous subarrays that sum to `k`.

## Note

- We don't calculate prefix sum before hand as then we might we including `prefixSum - k` into our hash map which from part of array which we have not covered yet.
- So that will un-necessarily increase the count as we will be removing `prefixSum - k` which are not part of our current subarray which starts from first to current element

## Implementation

```java
public int countSubarrays(int arr[], int k) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

    int prefixSum = 0;
    int count = 0;
    map.put(0, 1);

    for(int x: arr) {
        prefixSum += x;

        if(map.containsKey(prefixSum - k)) {
            count += map.get(prefixSum - k);
        }

        map.put(prefixSum, map.getOrDefault(prefixSum, 0) + 1);
    }

    return count;
}
```
