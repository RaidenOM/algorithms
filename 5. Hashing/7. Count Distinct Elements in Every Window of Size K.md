# Count Distinct Elements in Every Window of Size K

## Key Idea

This algorithm is designed to find the **number of distinct elements in every sliding window of size** `k` in an array. The key idea is to use a **HashMap to maintain frequency counts** of elements within the current window, and **update it** as the window slides one element at a time.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize a frequency map (HashMap):

- The keys are the elements in the window.
- The values are their respective counts.

**Step 2**: Process the first `k` elements:

- Add each element to the map.
- If an element is already in the map, increment its count.
- After this step, record the number of unique elements (i.e., `map.size()`).

**Step 3**: Slide the window through the rest of the array:

- For each new position:

  - **Remove the element** that's exiting the window:

    - If its frequency is 1, remove it from the map.
    - Otherwise, decrement its frequency count.

  - **Add the new incoming element** to the map:
    - If it's already in the map, increment its count.
    - Otherwise, insert it with count 1.

- Record the current number of unique elements.
- Continue sliding until the end of the array is reached.

**Step 4**: Return the list of unique counts, one for each window.

## Implementation

```java
public static ArrayList<Integer> countDistinct(int[] arr, int k) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i=0; i<k; i++) {
            map.put(arr[i], map.getOrDefault(arr[i], 0) + 1);
        }
        result.add(map.size());

        int low = 1;
        int high = k;
        while (high < n) {
            int outElement = arr[low - 1];
            if(map.get(outElement) == 1) map.remove(outElement);
            else map.put(outElement, map.get(outElement) - 1);

            int inElement = arr[high];
            map.put(inElement, map.getOrDefault(inElement, 0) + 1);

            low++;
            high++;

            result.add(map.size());
        }

        return result;
}
```
