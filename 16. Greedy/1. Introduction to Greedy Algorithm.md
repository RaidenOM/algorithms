# Introduction to Greedy Algorithm

A **greedy algorithm** is a problem-solving approach that makes the **locally optimal** choice at each step with the hope of finding the **global optimum**. It focuses on immediate gains without considering the long-term consequences. Greedy algorithms are simple, efficient, and often used for optimization problems.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Greedy Choice Property**:

   - At each step, the algorithm makes the best possible choice based on the current state.
   - It never reconsiders past choices.

2. **Optimal Substructure**:

   - The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, and the optimal solution to the overall problem depends on the optimal solutions to the subproblems.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Greedy algorithms are often faster than other approaches (e.g., dynamic programming) because they make decisions based on immediate gains.

## How It Works

1. Start with an empty solution set.
2. Iterate through the problem, making the best possible choice at each step.
3. Repeat until the problem is solved.

## General Code Structure

- Initialize `res = 0`
- Do the following while all items are not considered:
  - `i = selectAnItem()`
  - `if(feasible(i)) res = res + i`
- Return `res`
