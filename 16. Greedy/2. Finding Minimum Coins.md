# Finding Minimum Coins

The algorithm is designed to determine the minimum number of coins needed to make a given amount using a set of coin denominations.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1: Sort the Coin Denominations in Descending Order**

- The algorithm first sorts the given list of coin denominations in decreasing order.
- This ensures that we prioritize using the largest possible coin values first, which helps minimize the total number of coins needed.

**Step 2: Initialize Result Counter**

- A variable `res` is initialized to 0.
- This variable will keep track of the total number of coins used.

**Step 3: Iterate Through the Sorted Coin List**

- The algorithm iterates through each coin value in the sorted list.
- For each coin:
  - It calculates how many times that coin fits into the remaining amount (amount / coin).
  - It adds this count to `res` (total coin count).
  - It reduces the amount by the value of these coins (count \* coin).

**Step 4: Stop if Amount Reaches Zero**

- After processing each coin, the algorithm checks:
  - If the remaining amount becomes zero, it immediately stops and returns `res` (total coins used).

**Step 5: Return the Minimum Number of Coins**

- Once the loop is complete, the algorithm returns the total number of coins used (`res`).
- This is the optimal number of coins required to make up the given amount using a greedy approach.

## Implementation

```java
public static int minCoin(int amount, Integer[] coins) {
        Arrays.sort(coins, Collections.reverseOrder());
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) {
            int count = amount / coins[i];
            res += count;
            amount -= count * coins[i];
            if (amount == 0)
                break;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
