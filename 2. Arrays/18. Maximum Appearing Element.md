# Maximum Appearing Element

Given two arrays showing starting and ending intervals. The task is to find an element which appears the most.

# Key Idea

- Instead of iterating over every interval and every number in it (which would be slow), we use a **range frequency array**.
- Hereâ€™s the trick:
  - For each interval `[L, R]`, increment frequency at `L` and decrement frequency at `R+1`.
  - Then do a **prefix sum** to calculate how many intervals each index is part of.
- This works because:
  - Every time we hit `L`, we "start counting" that range.
  - Every time we hit `R+1`, we "stop counting" that range.
  - The prefix sum at index `i` tells us how many intervals include `i`.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Input

- `left[]` and `right[]` arrays, each of size `n` (representing n intervals)

**Step 2**: Create a frequency array

- `frequency[0...99]` initialized to 0 (Assumes input values are between 0 and 99)

**Step 3**: Mark the intervals

- For each interval `[left[i], right[i]]`:
  - Increment `frequency[left[i]] += 1`
  - Decrement `frequency[right[i] + 1] -= 1`

**Step 4**: Convert to prefix sum

- For each index `i` from 1 to 99:
  - `frequency[i] += frequency[i - 1]`
- This gives how many intervals include each index.

**Step 5**: Find maximum frequency index

- Traverse `frequency[]` to find the index with the maximum value.
- Return that index.

## Implementation

```java
public static int maximumAppearingElement(int[] left, int[] right) {
    int[] frequency = new int[101];  // allow up to 100 for right[i] + 1

    // mark frequency range
    for (int i = 0; i < left.length; i++) {
        frequency[left[i]]++;
        if (right[i] + 1 < frequency.length)
            frequency[right[i] + 1]--;
    }

    // apply prefix sum to get actual frequencies
    for (int i = 1; i < frequency.length; i++) {
        frequency[i] += frequency[i - 1];
    }

    // find index with max frequency
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < frequency.length; i++) {
        if (frequency[i] > frequency[res])
            res = i;
    }

    return res;
}
```
