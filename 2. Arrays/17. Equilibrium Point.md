# Equilibrium Point

An equilibrium point in an array is an index `i` such that the sum of elements before `i` (left side) is equal to the sum of elements after `i` (right side).

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: First, compute the total sum of the array (rSum), which acts as the right-side sum initially.

**Step 2**: Start from the beginning of the array and iterate through it.

**Step 3**: At each index `i`:

- Subtract `arr[i]` from `rSum` (because now we're considering index `i` as the equilibrium point, so `arr[i]` should not be counted in the right sum).
- Check if the left sum (`lSum`) is equal to the right sum (`rSum`):
  - If yes, return `true` â†’ equilibrium point found.
  - Otherwise, add `arr[i]` to `lSum` (move to the next index).

**Step 4**: If no such point is found, return `false`.

## Implementation

```java
public static boolean equilibriumPoint(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;

    int rSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        rSum += arr[i];
    }

    int lSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        rSum -= arr[i];
        if (lSum == rSum)
            return true;
        lSum += arr[i];
    }
    return false;
}
```
