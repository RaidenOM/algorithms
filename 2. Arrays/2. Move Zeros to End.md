# Move Zeros to End

The goal is to rearrange the array so that all non-zero elements retain their relative order while all zeros are moved to the end of the array. This is achieved using the two-pointer technique where one pointer (count) keeps track of the next position to place a non-zero element, and the other pointer (i) iterates over the array.

## How It Works?

1. **Pointer Movement**:

   - The count pointer identifies the index where the next non-zero element should be placed.
   - The `i` pointer iterates through the array to find non-zero elements.

2. **Swapping**:

   - When a non-zero element is found, it is swapped with the element at the count index. This ensures all non-zero elements are pushed to the front of the array.

3. **Zero Shifting**:
   - Zeros automatically shift to the back of the array as non-zero elements are placed at the front.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialization

- Start with `count = 0` (index of the first position for non-zero elements).

**Step 2**: Traverse the Array

- Iterate through the array with a loop using `i` as the current index.
- For each element:
  - Check if it is non-zero.
  - If it is, swap it with the element at the count index and increment count.

**Step 3**: End Condition

- Once the loop completes, all non-zero elements will be at the front, and all zeros will be at the back.

**Step 4**: Output

- The array is now modified in place with the desired arrangement.

## Implementation

```java
public static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
    // Swap elements at indices i and j
    int temp = arr[i];
    arr[i] = arr[j];
    arr[j] = temp;
}

public static void moveZerosToEnd(int[] arr) {
    int count = 0; // Pointer to track the position for the next non-zero element

    // Iterate through the array
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        // If the current element is non-zero
        if (arr[i] != 0) {
            // Swap the current element with the element at 'count'
            swap(arr, i, count);
            // Move the 'count' pointer to the next position
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```
