# Trapping Rain Water

## Problem Statement

You're given an array `height` of length `n` where each element represents the height of a bar. The width of each bar is 1 unit.

**Goal**: Compute how much water can be trapped after raining.

## Key Idea

At each index, the water that can be trapped depends on the minimum of the maximum heights to its left and right, minus the height at that index.

However, instead of precomputing left and right maximums with extra space, we can use a two-pointer approach that works in O(n) time and O(1) space.

- We keep track of left-max and right-max for variables left and right respectively.
- We use the idea that at any instant we either need the left-max or right-max depending on which one is smaller.
- If left-max is smaller, it decides the boundary and so we calculate for left wall otherwise we calculate for right wall. We need left and right pointers to calculate left-max and right-max. We can only compute for the space between left-max and left, right and right-max.
- We update left-max and right-max depending on the values of left and right pointers.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize pointers and state:

- `left = 0`, `right = n - 1` -` lMax = arr[0]`, `rMax = arr[n-1]` – keep track of the tallest bars seen so far from left and right
- `water = 0` – accumulate total trapped water

**Step 2**: Traverse while `left <= right`:

- At each step, we decide whether to move the left pointer or the right pointer:

  - If `lMax <= rMax`:

    This means the left side is the limiting factor for water trapping.

    - If `arr[left] > lMax`: update `lMax`

    - Else: water can be trapped = `lMax - arr[left]`; add to total. We don't do `lMax - arr[right]` as there could be a greater element of left of `right` that would give a greater result.

    - Move left pointer to the right (`left++`)

  - Else (i.e., `rMax < lMax`):

    The right side is the limiting factor.

    - If `arr[right] > rMax`: update rMax

    - Else: water trapped = `rMax - arr[right]`; add to total. We don't do `rMax - arr[left]` as there could be a greater element of right of `left` that would give a greater result.

    - Move right pointer to the left (`right--`)

**Step 3**: Return `water` at the end

## Implementation

```java
public int maxWater(int arr[]) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int lMax = arr[0];
    int rMax = arr[n-1];
    int left = 1;
    int right = n - 2;

    int water = 0;

    while(left <= right) {
        // left max is boundary
        if(lMax <= rMax) {
            if(arr[left] > lMax) lMax = arr[left]; // No water can be trapped as it is the tallest so far
            else {
                water += lMax - arr[left];
            }
            left++;
        }else { // right max is boundary
            if(arr[right] > rMax) rMax = arr[right]; // No water can be trapped as it is the tallest so far
            else {
                water += rMax - arr[right];
            }
            right--;
        }
    }

    return water;
}
```
