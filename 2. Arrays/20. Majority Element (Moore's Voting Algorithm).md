# Majority Element (Moore's Voting Algorithm)

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the **majority element**, i.e., an element that appears **more than ⌊n/2⌋ times** in the array, where `n` is the size of the array. If no such element exists, return `-1`.

## Key Idea

The algorithm uses the **Boyer-Moore Majority Voting Algorithm**, which is an efficient way to find a majority candidate in linear time and constant space.

There are two main steps:

- **Find a candidate** that might be the majority element.
- **Verify** if that candidate actually appears more than `n/2` times.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Finding the Majority Candidate (Boyer-Moore Voting)

- Initialize a candidate (first element of the array) and a counter set it to 1 (assuming first element as majority).
- Traverse the array:
  - If the current element is the same as the candidate, increment the counter.
  - If it's different, decrement the counter.
  - If the counter becomes less than 0, set the current element as the new candidate and reset the counter to 1.
- This phase ensures that if there is a majority element, it will be the candidate.

**Step 2**: Verification

- Go through the array again and count the occurrences of the candidate.
- If the count is greater than `n/2`, return the candidate.
- Otherwise, return `-1` (no majority element).

## Implementation

```java
static boolean isMajority(int[] arr, int x) {
    int count = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
        if(arr[i] == x) count++;
    }

    return count > arr.length/2;
}

static int majorityElement(int arr[]) {
    int result = arr[0];
    int count = 1;

    for(int i=1; i<arr.length; i++) {
        if(arr[i] == result) count++;
        else count--;

        if(count < 0) {
            result = arr[i];
            count = 1;
        }
    }

    return isMajority(arr, result) ? result : -1;
}
```
