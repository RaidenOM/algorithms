# Stock Buy and Sell Problem - Multiple Transactions Allowed

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` where `arr[i]` represents the price of a stock on the `i`-th day. The task is to find the maximum profit you can achieve by making as many transactions as you like, but you must sell before buying again (i.e., you cannot hold multiple stocks at once).

Each transaction consists of one buy followed by one sell. You can buy and sell on consecutive days if it gives you a profit. Your goal is to maximize the total profit.

## Key Idea

To maximize profit with multiple transactions:

- Buy when the price is going up.
- Instead of identifying exact buy/sell points, simply add up all positive price differences between consecutive days.
- This captures all the profit that could have been made by buying before each increase and selling after.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize `totalProfit = 0`.

**Step 2**: Iterate through the array from index `1` to `n-1`:

- For each day `i`, compare `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`.
- If `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]`:
  - There's a price increase â†’ profit opportunity.
  - Add the difference `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` to `totalProfit`.

**Step 3**: Return `totalProfit` at the end.

## Implementation

```java
int stockBuySell(int arr[]) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int totalProfit = 0;

    for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
        if(arr[i] > arr[i-1]) totalProfit += arr[i] - arr[i-1];
    }

    return totalProfit;
}
```
