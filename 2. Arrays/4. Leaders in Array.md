# Leaders in Array

The problem is to find leaders in an array. A leader is an element that is greater than or equal to all the elements to its right.

## How it Works?

By iterating from the rightmost end of the array:

1. Start by considering the last element as a leader (since there are no elements to its right).
2. As you traverse the array to the left, compare each element with the `currentLeader`:
   - If the element is greater than the `currentLeader`, it is a leader.
   - Update the `currentLeader` to the current element if it is greater.

This works because, at any point in the reverse traversal, the `currentLeader` always represents the largest value to the right of the current index.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialization

- Start with the last element of the array, which is always a leader since there are no elements to its right.
- Store this element in a variable currentLeader.

**Step 2**: Iterate Through the Array

- Traverse the array in reverse order (from the second-last element to the first).
- Compare the current element with the `currentLeader`.
  - If the current element is greater than `currentLeader`, print it as a leader and update `currentLeader` to this element.

**Step 3**: End

- Once the traversal is complete, all leaders have been identified and printed.

## Implementation

```java
public static void leadersInArray(int[] arr) {
    // Initialize the last element as the first leader
    int currentLeader = arr[arr.length - 1];
    System.out.println(currentLeader); // Print the last element as it is always a leader

    // Traverse the array in reverse order
    for (int i = arr.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        // If the current element is greater than the current leader
        if (arr[i] > currentLeader) {
            currentLeader = arr[i]; // Update the leader
            System.out.println(currentLeader); // Print the leader
        }
    }
}
```
