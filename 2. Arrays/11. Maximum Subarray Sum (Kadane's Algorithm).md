# Maximum Subarray Sum (Kadane's Algorithm)

To find the maximum sum of subarrays from an array.

## Key Idea

- This is Kadane's Algorithm, used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a 1D array of integers.
- We find the maximum sum subarray ending at current element for every element, we do so by deciding whether to continue the previous subarray or start a new one. We also keep track of maximum of these sums, which is our result.
- It smartly decides whether to extend the current subarray or start fresh from the current element.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize two variables:

- One to store the maximum sum (overall result)
- One to store the maximum sum ending at the current index

**Step 2**: Start from the first element:

- Set both variables to the first element's value.
- Loop through the rest of the array:

  - For each element, decide:

    - Should you extend the previous subarray (add current element)?

    - Or start fresh from the current element?

**Step 3**: Choose whichever gives a higher value (i.e., the better subarray ending here).

**Step 4**: Update the overall maximum if the current subarray ending here is greater than the previous overall max.

**Step 5**: Return the overall maximum after the loop ends.

## Implementation

```java
public static int maxSubarraySum(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;

    int maxSum = arr[0];
    int maxEnding = arr[0];

    for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
        maxEnding = Math.max(arr[i] + maxEnding, arr[i]);
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, maxEnding);
    }
    return maxSum;
}
```
