# Subarray with given Sum (Sliding Window)

To check whether an array contains a subarray whose sum is equal to given sum.

## Key Idea

This algorithm is designed to determine whether there exists a `contiguous subarray` within a given array that sums up to a specific target value.

It leverages the `two-pointer technique` (also called the sliding window method) to efficiently check all possible subarrays without restarting the sum calculation each time.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialize Window

- Start with two pointers (let’s call them `start` and `end`) at the beginning of the array.
- Use a variable to keep track of the current sum of the window between these pointers.

**Step 2**: Run a loop while `end` is less than size of array

- At every step check:
  - If current sum is less than given sum:
    - Add value at `end` to current sum.
    - Move `end` to next value.
  - If current sum is more than given sum:
    - Subtract value at `start` from current sum.
    - Move `start` to next value.

**Step 3**: Check for Match

- If at any point, the current sum matches the target sum, a valid subarray has been found — return `true`.

**Step 4**: Continue Until End

- Continue the above process until the end pointer reaches the end of the array.
- If no matching subarray is found by then, return `false`.

## Implementation

```java
public static boolean subarrayWithGivenSum(int[] arr, int sum) {
    int n = arr.length;

    int currentSum = 0;
    int start = 0;
    int end = 0;
    while (end < n) {
        if (currentSum > sum) {
            currentSum -= arr[start];
            start++;
        } else if (currentSum < sum) {
            currentSum += arr[end];
            end++;
        } else
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```
