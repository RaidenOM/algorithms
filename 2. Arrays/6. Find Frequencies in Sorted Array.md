# Find Frequencies in Sorted Array

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialization

- Start with a counter `count = 1` to track the frequency of the current element.
- Begin traversing the array from index 1 (the second element), since the first is already considered.

**Step 2**: Traverse the Array

- For each element from index 1 to the end of the array:
  - If the current element is equal to the previous one, it means the same value is repeating.
    - Increment count by 1 to reflect another occurrence.
  - If the current element is different from the previous one, it means the current group has ended:
    - Print the previous element and its frequency (`count`).
    - Reset `count = 1` to start counting the new group.

**Step 3**: Print the Last Group

- After the loop ends, the last group (which hasnâ€™t been printed yet) still needs to be handled.
- Print the last element in the array along with its frequency (`count`).

## Implementation

```java
public static void frequenciesInSorted(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int count = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] != arr[i - 1]) {
            System.out.println(arr[i - 1] + " " + count);
            count = 1;
        } else {
            count++;
        }
    }

    System.out.println(arr[n - 1] + " " + count);

}
```
