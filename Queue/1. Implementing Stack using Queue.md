# Implementing Stack using Queue

## How and Why It Works

1. We maintain two queues: `queue1` (active queue for stack operations) and `queue2`(temporary helper queue).
2. During the push operation, the new element is added to the top of the stack by rearranging the order of elements.
3. The pop and top operations are straightforward because `queue1` always contains the stack in the correct order.

By always keeping `queue1` as the main queue with the correct order for stack operations, the LIFO behavior is preserved.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Initialization

- Create two queues, `queue1` and `queue2`.

**Step 2**: Push Operation (`push(x)`)

- Transfer all elements from `queue1` to `queue2`.
- Add the new element `x` to `queue1`. This ensures `x` is at the front of `queue1`, simulating the top of the stack.
- Transfer all elements from `queue2` back to `queue1`. This restores the LIFO order in `queue1`.
- Result: `queue1` now holds all elements with `x` at the front.

**Step 3**: Pop Operation (`pop()`)

- Remove the front element of `queue1` using `poll()` and return it.
- Result: The stack’s topmost element is removed.

**Step 4**: Top Operation (top())

- Return the front element of `queue1` using `peek()` without removing it.
- Result: You get the stack’s topmost element.

## Implementation

```java
class StackFromQueue {
    Queue<Integer> queue1; // Main queue to hold stack elements
    Queue<Integer> queue2; // Helper queue for rearranging elements

    StackFromQueue() {
        queue1 = new LinkedList<>();
        queue2 = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    // Push an element onto the stack
    public void push(int x) {
        // Step 1: Move all elements from queue1 to queue2
        while (!queue1.isEmpty()) {
            queue2.offer(queue1.poll());
        }

        // Step 2: Add the new element to queue1
        queue1.offer(x);

        // Step 3: Move all elements back from queue2 to queue1
        while (!queue2.isEmpty()) {
            queue1.offer(queue2.poll());
        }
    }

    // Remove and return the top element of the stack
    public int pop() {
        return queue1.poll(); // Remove the front element of queue1
    }

    // Return the top element of the stack without removing it
    public int top() {
        return queue1.peek(); // Peek the front element of queue1
    }
}
```
