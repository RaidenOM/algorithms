# Reversing a Queue

# Method 1 (Using a Stack)

1. Use a stack and dequeue all items and push it onto stack one by one.
2. Pop all items from stack and enqueue all items to it one by one.
3. The queue now holds item in reversed order

# Method 2 (Iterative)

The algorithm reverses a queue using recursion. The idea is to repeatedly remove elements from the front of the queue, reverse the remaining queue, and then add the removed element back to the rear. This ensures the last element of the queue becomes the first.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Base Case

- If the queue is empty, return. This stops the recursion.

**Step 2**: Recursive Step

- Remove the front element of the queue using `poll()` and store it in a temporary variable (`temp`).
- Recursively call the function on the remaining queue.

**Step 3**: Rebuilding the Queue

- After the recursive call returns, the queue has been reversed.
- Add the stored element (`temp`) to the back of the queue using `offer()`.

## Implementation

```java
public static void reverseQueue(Queue<Integer> queue) {
    // Base case: if the queue is empty, return
    if (queue.isEmpty()) {
        return;
    }

    // Step 1: Remove the front element
    int temp = queue.poll();

    // Step 2: Reverse the remaining queue recursively
    reverseQueue(queue);

    // Step 3: Add the removed element to the back
    queue.offer(temp);
}
```
