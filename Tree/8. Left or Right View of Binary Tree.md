# Left/Right View of Binary Tree

The left/right view of a binary tree consists of the nodes that are visible when the tree is viewed from the left side/right side. The leftmost/rightmost node at each level of the tree is included in the left view/right view. It is basically Level-order traversal line by line with an extra condition

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Handle the Edge Case

- If the tree is empty (root is `null`), return immediately.

**Step 2**: Initialize a Queue for Level-Order Traversal

- Use a queue to perform level-order traversal of the tree.
- Add the root node to the queue to start the process.

**Step 3**: Process Each Level

- Use a loop to process nodes level by level.
- For each level, calculate the number of nodes in the queue (this represents the size of the current level).
- During traversal, the first node in the queue for each level represents the leftmost node and the last node, rightmost. Print or store this node.

**Step 4**: Add Child Nodes

- For each node processed, add its left and right children (if they exist) to the queue for subsequent levels.

**Step 5**: Repeat for All Levels

- Continue processing levels until the queue is empty, ensuring that all levels are traversed and the leftmost nodes are captured.

## Implementation

```java
public static void printLeftView(Node root) {
    // Handle the edge case of an empty tree
    if (root == null) {
        return;
    }

    // Initialize a queue for level-order traversal
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.offer(root); // Start with the root node

    // Loop until all levels are processed
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        // Determine the number of nodes at the current level
        int levelSize = queue.size();

        // Traverse all nodes at the current level
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            // Remove the front node from the queue
            Node current = queue.poll();

            // Print the first node of each level (leftmost node)
            if (i == 0) {   // (i == levelSize - 1) for rightmost
                System.out.print(current.data + " ");
            }

            // Enqueue the left child if it exists
            if (current.left != null) {
                queue.offer(current.left);
            }

            // Enqueue the right child if it exists
            if (current.right != null) {
                queue.offer(current.right);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
