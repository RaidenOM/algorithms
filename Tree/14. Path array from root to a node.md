# Path array from root to a node

This method generates list of nodes that form a path from root to a given node. It does this by traversing the tree, adding nodes to a list, and backtracking if it doesn't find the target node along the current path.

## Step by Step Algorithm

**Step 1**: Base Case (Null Node)

- The first step in the function checks if the current node (root) is `null`. If it is, it returns `false`. This handles the case where we reach an empty tree or a leaf node without finding the target.

**Step 2**: Add Current Node to Path

- If the current node is not `null`, it is added to the path (list) since it's part of the current potential path.

**Step 3**: Check if Current Node is the Target

- Next, the function checks if the current node's data (`root.data`) matches the target value. If it does, then the current node is part of the path to the target, and the function returns `true`. This is the successful case where the target node is found.

**Step 4**: Recursive Search in Left or Right Subtree

- If the current node is not the target, the function recursively searches both the left and right subtrees of the current node.
- If either the left or right subtree returns `true`, it means the target was found in that subtree, and the path is valid. The function returns `true` and the path will include the current node as part of the valid path.

**Step 5**: Backtracking (Remove Node from Path)

- If neither the left nor right subtree contains the target node, the current node is removed from the path (`list`) because it's not part of the correct path to the target.
- The function then returns `false` to indicate that this path does not lead to the target node.

## Implementation

```java
public static boolean generatePathArray(ArrayList<Node> list, Node root, int target) {
    // Base case: if the node is null, return false
    if (root == null)
        return false;

    // Add the current node to the path
    list.add(root);

    // If current node is the target, return true
    if (root.data == target)
        return true;

    // Recursively search left and right subtrees
    if (generatePathArray(list, root.left, target) || generatePathArray(list, root.right, target)) {
        return true;
    }

    // If target not found, backtrack by removing the current node from path
    list.remove(root);
    return false;
}
```
